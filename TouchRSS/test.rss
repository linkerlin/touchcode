            <title>Help Out With &quot;Barack To School&quot;</title>
            <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/ORbaracktoschool/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/Oregon/Pics/CanvassInOregon.jpg&quot; width=&quot;338&quot; height=&quot;324&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Last week, Barack officially accepted the Democratic nomination for president at the historic Open Convention in Denver.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and Democrats up and down the ballot can bring change to Oregon and America this fall, but it will take thousands of new voices joining the political process to make it happen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With Oregon students arriving at school this month and thousands of unregistered voters tuning into politics during the conventions, now is the perfect time to reach out to them through our &quot;Barack to School&quot; voter registration drive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This weekend, fellow supporters will be coming together at schools, farmers markets, and door-to-door in neighborhoods like yours to help bring the change this country needs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/ORbaracktoschool/&quot;&gt;Find an event near you and sign up now to join your fellow supporters this weekend.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After a successful Weekend of Action over Labor Day, we have just a few weeks left to register thousands of voters in Oregon. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No one of us could do this alone, but with this grassroots movement growing across the state, we can do this together.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No experience is required to get involved. Just bring your enthusiasm and hunger for change -- Campaign for Change staff will be there with all the support you need.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Face-to-face contact is the best way to connect with fellow Oregonians and give people the power to participate in our system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sign up today for a voter registration event in your area:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>August Jobs Report Shows Unemployment At Highest Level Since September 2003</title>
            <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUGUST JOBS REPORT SHOWS UNEMPLOYMENT AT HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE SEPTEMBER 2003&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Oregonians have lost 10,400 jobs since Bush took office, Obama&#039;s plan would provide Oregon&#039;s economy with over $621,218,856&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Portland, OR &lt;/b&gt;- Today, the Labor Department released the August jobs report showing the eighth straight month of job losses.  The unemployment rate has jumped to 6.1% and approximately 84,000 jobs have been lost over the last month.  So far, the economy has lost 605,000 jobs in 2008, and right now more than 9 million Americans are looking for work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oregon&#039;s economy has not escaped the national downturn. Since Bush took office, the unemployment rate in Oregon is 6%, and the state has lost 10,400, 8,900 of which were manufacturing jobs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sen. Obama would enact an immediate economic stimulus plan that would provide 1.8 million workers in Oregon with Obama&#039;s Making Work Pay tax cut of $500 per worker and $1000 per family, providing Oregon&#039;s economy with over $621,218,856. Sen. Obama&#039;s statement is below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &quot;Today&#039;s jobs report is a reminder of what&#039;s at stake in this election - John McCain showed last night that he is intent on continuing the economic policies that just this year have caused the American economy to lose 605,000 jobs.  John McCain may believe that the fundamentals of our economy are &#039;strong,&#039; but the working men and women I meet every day are working harder for less, the typical working age family&#039;s income is down $2,000 since George Bush took office, and their purchasing power is as low as it&#039;s been in a decade.  John McCain&#039;s answer is more of the same:  $200 billion in tax cuts to big corporations and oil companies, and not one dime of tax relief to more than 100 million middle-class families.  If I am President, I will cut taxes for 95% of all working families and provide an immediate $50 billion to struggling states so that they don&#039;t have to cut back on health care and education and can rebuild roads and schools. That&#039;s the change working families need right now,&quot; said Senator Barack Obama.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Barack Obama will work hard to solve this economic crisis and help American families.

            <title>Republicans for Obama Launch and Press Conference</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Wednesday, prominent Oregonians from across the Portland area gathered to announce the launch of Republicans for Obama.  This group of former and currently-registered Republicans endorsed Barack Obama for President and announced their efforts in the state of  Oregon to help Sen. Obama win in November. &lt;br /&gt;       &lt;br /&gt; The group discussed how Bush&#039;s failures and Obama&#039;s policies drew them to come out for the candidates, as well as their efforts to bring fellow Republicans and independents in the state  over to support Obama. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;object width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/z5fugUQw&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;transparent&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/z5fugUQw&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  Don Holden, a retired Army Colonel who served in WWII in Europe and on Okinawa, shared these words with the crowd: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was a lifetime Eisenhower Republican until the Bush Administration&#039;s ill-conceived preemptive invasion of Iraq, which I consider to be the biggest strategic blunder in my lifetime.  Obama and Biden understand that going to war should only be considered as a last resort after all diplomatic means have been exhausted, the objective is clearly defined, and our vital national interest is at stake. My grandson served a year in Iraq and is still in the National Guard. Obama and Biden understand that the National Guard and reserves were never intended to be used as a foreign occupation force for an indefinite period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;   Mary Jean Rivera, a former elementary and junior high school principal, had this to say about Senator Obama:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; It&#039;s time for a change, for a change who can present and hold up our American ideals once agina.  I am impressed by Obama&#039;s thoughtful and principled approach. Obama and Biden will certainly have my vote!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;     George Atiyeh, an airline pilot, delivered this statement: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I am a lifelong Republican and former and former Army Reserve officer who has watched and participated in picking the President since Ike Eisenhower.  For the last eight years, I have witnessed our Republican Party lose its direction, rot its roots, and no longer resemble the party I grew up in... Eight years ago, John McCain represented change, but now he too has lost his way and has embraced the policies of George W. Bush.  Barack Obama, in contrast, is prepared to turn this country around and get us back on track.  Rarely do we, as Americans, have the opportunity to elect a man who has the potential to bring real positive change.  Barack Obama is that man and he has my wholehearted support and I intend to work for him, not just for myself but for my eight grandchildren.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  Are you a Republican who plans on supporting Barack Obama in November? &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/orstory&quot;&gt; Let us know. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Weekend of Action: Obama Supporters Work for Change</title>
            <description>Over Labor Day weekend, Oregonians across the state worked for change in Weekend of Action events.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Supporters in Salem spent their Saturday canvassing voters in their neighborhoods.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;object width=&#039;400&#039; height=&#039;400&#039;&gt;&lt;param name=&#039;movie&#039; value=&#039;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/2LmReJU6&#039;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&#039;wmode&#039; value=&#039;transparent&#039;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&#039;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/2LmReJU6&#039; type=&#039;application/x-shockwave-flash&#039; wmode=&#039;transparent&#039; width=&#039;400&#039; height=&#039;400&#039;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Corvallis held phone-banking and voter registration events throughout the weekend.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;object width=&#039;400&#039; height=&#039;400&#039;&gt;&lt;param name=&#039;movie&#039; value=&#039;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/IhZAB65o&#039;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&#039;wmode&#039; value=&#039;transparent&#039;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&#039;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/IhZAB65o&#039; type=&#039;application/x-shockwave-flash&#039; wmode=&#039;transparent&#039; width=&#039;400&#039; height=&#039;400&#039;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Junction City and small towns across Oregon, supporters took time out of their weekend to share Barack Obama&#039;s plan for America.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;object width=&#039;400&#039; height=&#039;400&#039;&gt;&lt;param name=&#039;movie&#039; value=&#039;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/AmHEXGqu&#039;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&#039;wmode&#039; value=&#039;transparent&#039;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&#039;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/AmHEXGqu&#039; type=&#039;application/x-shockwave-flash&#039; wmode=&#039;transparent&#039; width=&#039;400&#039; height=&#039;400&#039;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Albany supporters didn&#039;t let Sunday&#039;s weather keep them from lending a hand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;object width=&#039;400&#039; height=&#039;400&#039;&gt;&lt;param name=&#039;movie&#039; value=&#039;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/FT0aaUSN&#039;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&#039;wmode&#039; value=&#039;transparent&#039;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&#039;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/FT0aaUSN&#039; type=&#039;application/x-shockwave-flash&#039; wmode=&#039;transparent&#039; width=&#039;400&#039; height=&#039;400&#039;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Weekend of Action was a great success, with Campaign for Change events taking place in all 36 of Oregon&#039;s counties.  There is still time to get involved in this historic movement.

            <title>Weekend of Action: Kick-off Rally in NE Portland</title>
            <description>The Weekend of Action in Oregon kicked off with a rally last Saturday in NE Portland.  Dozens of supporters gathered to listen to General Election Director Jack Shapiro address the crowd at the NE Portland Campaign for Change office.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fired up and ready for change, the crowd took to neighborhoods across Portland, as hundreds of others were doing the same in communities throughout the state.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Supporters enjoyed the beautiful day out on the streets, putting their energy into expressing Barack Obama&#039;s message of change.  Canvassers talked with their neighbors about why they support Senator Obama, and registered scores of new voters to deepen the pool of potential voters for November.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Weekend of Action: Obama Supporters Active All Across Oregon</title>
            <description>Following Senator Barack Obama&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv8eiDvrHJ4&quot;&gt; landmark speech &lt;/a&gt; last Thursday in Denver, many Oregonians found themselves asking &quot;what can I do to help?&quot;  Whether they had been making calls every weekend since March, or had never knocked a door or registered a voter before, men and women across the state looked to channel their energy inspired by Barack&#039;s words into action, into the sort of grassroots organizing that will bring substantive change to our country. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was in light of this inspiration, and the three day weekend afforded to most Oregonians by the Labor Day holiday, that Barack Obama&#039;s Campaign for Change held canvasses in all 36 counties in Oregon.  This was the first time in history that a volunteer effort of this scale had taken place. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Supporters young and old reached out across Oregon:  they made phone calls to undecided voter in Medford, sharing their personal reasons why they support Obama; they went door to door to speak face to face with their neighbors about Obama in towns like La Grande, Astoria, Grants Pass, and Bend; they held voter registration drives at a University of Oregon football game in Eugene, at a rally in NE Portland. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Weekend of Action marked the latest chapter in a campaign that has been built and powered by grassroots activism, by ordinary Americans taking a few hours from their busy lives to work for the sort of change they want to see in the world.  Thanks so much to all of the volunteers who put time aside from their busy schedules this weekend to lend a hand.  This campaign is about you, and it couldn&#039;t exist without you. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This is the time to get involved.  Even if you&#039;ve never volunteered before, visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/oroffices/&quot;&gt; your local Campaign for Change office &lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/orvolunteers&quot;&gt; signup to help out &lt;/a&gt;.  Become a part of this historical movement.  Remember: change can&#039;t happen without you. &lt;/strong&gt;</description>

            <title>Help Gulf Coast residents and first responders</title>
            <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Today, the thoughts and prayers of all Americans are with those in the path of Hurricane Gustav -- and many of you are asking what you can do to help. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 We do not yet know what the impact of Hurricane Gustav will be, and we hope with all our hearts that the damage will not be as great as it was three years ago. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
  But we know there will be damage, and there is something you can do right now. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Your financial support will strengthen organizations like the American Red Cross that are evacuating Gulf Coast residents and planning to help communities get back on their feet. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://american.redcross.org/site/PageServer?pagename=ntld_main&quot;&gt; Make a donation to support the American Red Cross today &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At times like this, it is our compassion and resilience that define who we are as a nation. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please give whatever you can afford, even $10, to make sure the American Red Cross has the resources to help those in the path of this storm: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://american.redcross.org/site/PageServer?pagename=ntld_main&quot;&gt; https://donate.barackobama.com/redcross &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
  Thank you for your generosity, and I hope you will join Michelle and me in praying for the safety of those in the path of the storm and the first responders who are doing all they can to ensure the safety of their communities. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Please find out how you can help by visiting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redcross.org/&quot;&gt;American Red Cross &lt;/a&gt;or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.savethechildren.org/emergencies/hurricane-gustav/hurricane-gustav.html&quot;&gt;Save The Children &lt;/a&gt;today.

            <title>Oregonians Gather to Watch Obama Accept Historic Nomination</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night, supporters across Oregon and the country watched as history was made.  Before thousands of supporters in Denver, and with millions watching across America, Senator Barack Obama took to the stage and accepted the Democratic Party&#039;s nomination for President of the United States of America.  Obama spoke of uniting a country that has seen eight years fall short of its dreams, of common ground, of the need for Americans of every strip and background to come together to confront and overcome the significant challenges that face us.  As he spoke that night, Obama offered legitimate hope, he offered pragmatic methods, he offered a change from the direction of the last eight years.  And now, with less than 70 days until Americans will issue a referendum on these past eight years, when we will speak up and elect a new leader, the time has never been better to join the Campaign for Change.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/orvolunteers&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/orvolunteers&quot;&gt;Become involved, let your voice be heard, and be a part of this historical movement. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Portland&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;object width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/Ms99zvMy&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;transparent&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/Ms99zvMy&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;La Grande&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;object width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/qhjZIQnh&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;transparent&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/qhjZIQnh&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Salem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;object width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/UZYfzzcQ&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;transparent&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/UZYfzzcQ&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Bend&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;object width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/2Nn3ef74&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;transparent&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/2Nn3ef74&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Medford&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;object width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/m5g8A9a2&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;transparent&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/m5g8A9a2&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;NE Portland&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;object width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/sf5mqVyf&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;transparent&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/sf5mqVyf&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Beaverton&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;object width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/nQ9QgbCh&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;transparent&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/nQ9QgbCh&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Roseburg&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;object width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/aX4xmqHk&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;transparent&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/aX4xmqHk&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;</description>

            <title>Oregonians Respond To Selection Of Palin As Running Mate</title>
            <description>OREGONIANS RESPOND TO SELECTION OF PALIN AS RUNNING MATE &lt;br /&gt;    &lt;strong&gt; Say Palin is not a game changer and will only continue more of the same &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;PORTLAND, OR &lt;/strong&gt; - Today, on his 72nd birthday, Sen. John McCain announced first-term Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his Vice-Presidential running mate.  Prior to serving as Governor of Alaska, a state with a total population less than Multnomah County, Palin served as a part-time Mayor of Wasilla, AK, a town of less than 9,000. Oregonians&#039; responses to the McCain-Palin ticket are below. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;       &lt;strong&gt;Oregon Governor Ted Kulongoski: &lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Today, John McCain has put Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, a governor who has only been in office for less than two years, with zero foreign policy experience, a heartbeat away from the presidency.  John McCain, himself, said that a president must have &#039;the national security experience and background to lead this nation&#039;. When you compare her credentials with Sen. Joe Biden, who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and one of the foremost foreign policy experts who has met with both allies and enemies, it&#039;s clear that the Obama-Biden ticket is the right choice with the judgment we need to keep America safe in the years ahead.&amp;quot;    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Rep. Darlene Hooley (D-Ore.): &lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Today, Sen. John McCain has provided yet another example of his questionable judgment and put Gov. Sarah Palin, the former part-time mayor of a town of 9,000, a heartbeat away from the presidency.  This pick had nothing to do with being qualified to be president, which Gov. Palin clearly isn&#039;t.  It had everything to do with McCain trying to salvage his campaign.&amp;quot;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.):&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Frankly, I&#039;m surprised by the pick. For John McCain to put so much focus on national security experience and then pick Gov. Sarah Palin, who has no foreign policy experience whatsoever, shows he lacks the judgment we need in our president.  McCain may think this is a game changer, but Gov. Palin doesn&#039;t change the fact that the Republican ticket is offering more of the same instead of the change we need.&amp;quot;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Susan Castillo, Oregon Superintendant of Public Instruction: &lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Barack Obama is right, McCain is not the one to bring about change and by adding Palin to the ticket we&#039;ll just get more of the same. Sarah Palin shares John McCain&#039;s commitment to overturning Roe v. Wade and to continuing George Bush&#039;s failed economic and energy policies. It&#039;s clear that McCain&#039;s choice of Palin has more to do with trying to light up his dim campaign than it does about making the right choice to lead our nation. As a woman, this strengthens my resolve to work even harder to get Obama-Biden elected to bring the change we need.&amp;quot;     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Jeff Cogen, Multnomah County Commissioner, District 2:&lt;/strong&gt;  &amp;quot;We wouldn&#039;t put a two year county commissioner of Multnomah County a single heartbeat away from the presidency, especially when you consider that John McCain is twenty three years older than the State of Alaska.&amp;quot;</description>

            <title>Video: Barack Obama at Mile High -- &quot;The American Promise&quot;</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/hqblog&quot; title=&quot;Live from the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/blog/ConventionIcon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;On a cloudless August night in Denver, before a united party and thousands of grassroots supporters  from all across America, Senator Obama accepted the Democratic Party presidential nomination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/kv8eiDvrHJ4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/kv8eiDvrHJ4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama made the case for why America cannot afford four more years of the same failed policies and laid out his vision to bring about fundamental change at home and abroad. He reminded us of the extraordinary promise of America at its best and challenged us to continue to fight for that promise, to march ahead, to not turn back...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3104/2807215417_d6a5af829f.jpg?v=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That promise is our greatest inheritance.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours &amp;ndash; a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln&amp;rsquo;s Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The men and women who gathered there could&amp;rsquo;ve heard many things.&amp;nbsp; They could&amp;rsquo;ve heard words of anger and discord.&amp;nbsp; They could&amp;rsquo;ve been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what the people heard instead &amp;ndash; people of every creed and color, from every walk of life &amp;ndash; is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked.&amp;nbsp; That together, our dreams can be one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We cannot walk alone,&amp;rdquo; the preacher cried.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.&amp;nbsp; We cannot turn back.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;America, we cannot turn back.&amp;nbsp; Not with so much work to be done.&amp;nbsp; Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for.&amp;nbsp; Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save.&amp;nbsp; Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend.&amp;nbsp; America, we cannot turn back.&amp;nbsp; We cannot walk alone.&amp;nbsp; At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future.&amp;nbsp; Let us keep that promise &amp;ndash; that American promise &amp;ndash; and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;                               &lt;p&gt;To all of our supporters, from those who have been with this remarkable campaign from the beginning to those of you who are just joining this movement for change: if you agree that we cannot turn back now -- that this is our moment to seize -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://donate.barackobama.com/page/contribute/dncd4p1?source=HQblog&quot;&gt;please make a donation today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/samgrahamfelsen/gG5l5C&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Continue reading for the full remarks as prepared for delivery... &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>&quot;With one voice&quot; - Barack Obama Becomes the Democratic Party Nominee</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, in the midst of a formal roll call of the votes of all the delegates, Hillary Clinton made an announcement from her place on the floor among the New York delegation, moving to suspend the roll call and nominate Barack Obama as the Democratic candidate for President of the United States:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;On behalf of the great state of New York, with appreciation for the spirit and dedication of all who are gathered here, with eyes firmly fixed on the future, in the spirit of unity... let&#039;s declare all together, with one voice, right here and right now, that Barack Obama is our candidate and he will be our president.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton&#039;s motion suspended the rules while still formally counting state votes, and after a unanimous round of &amp;quot;ayes&amp;quot; Nancy Pelosi closed the proceedings, declaring Barack Obama the official nominee of the Democratic Party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the video of this incredible, historic moment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/vWCQYfyO6p4&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/vWCQYfyO6p4&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;</description>

            <title>Oregonians Host Women for Obama House Parties</title>
            <description>Yesterday, women across Oregon gathered to celebrate the 88th anniversary of The Nineteenth Amendment, which gave women the right to vote in the United States.  This historical event was paid fitting tribute by Senator Hillary Clinton, whose own historical campaign in the Democratic primaries this year placed, as Senator Clinton put it, &quot;18,000,000 cracks in the glass ceiling&quot;. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Supporters gathered in homes throughout Oregon and across the country, some sharing their experiences from the primaries, some discussing their opinions and the great strides made in that contest, and all of them watching as Senator Clinton gave a stirring speech. &quot;Whether you voted for me, or voted for Barack, the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose,&quot; Clinton said, asking democrats and Americans of all stripes to come together and work to elect Barack Obama this November. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;object width=&#039;500&#039; height=&#039;500&#039;&gt;&lt;param name=&#039;movie&#039; value=&#039;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/9dtK8NIk&#039;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&#039;wmode&#039; value=&#039;transparent&#039;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&#039;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/9dtK8NIk&#039; type=&#039;application/x-shockwave-flash&#039; wmode=&#039;transparent&#039; width=&#039;500&#039; height=&#039;500&#039;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are less than 70 days until Election Day.  As Senator Clinton said, we can&#039;t afford four more years of the last eight years in John McCain.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/orvolunteers&quot;&gt; Volunteer today &lt;/a&gt;, become part of this historic movement, and help bring hope and change to Oregon.</description>

            <title>Oregonians Respond to News of Obama-Biden Ticket</title>
            <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PORTLAND, OR&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Yesterday, Sen. Barack Obama announced Sen. Joe Biden as his vice-presidential running mate before a crowd of tens of thousands in Springfield, Ill. Responses from elected officials and community leaders from across Oregon are below.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;State Sen. Margaret Carter, President Pro Tempore (D-Portland): &amp;ldquo;Democrats have a dream team!&amp;nbsp; An Obama-Biden ticket brings together the experience, leadership and vision necessary to bring peace to the world, and make America strong abroad again.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;State Sen. Ben Westlund (D-Tumalo), Democratic Candidate for Oregon Treasurer: &amp;ldquo;I am very &lt;br /&gt;pleased with Barack&amp;rsquo;s choice for Vice President.&amp;nbsp; Joe Biden is a strong long leader on national defense and understands the challenges facing today&amp;rsquo;s working families.&amp;nbsp; He has the right priorities.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;State Rep. Mary Nolan (D-Portland): &amp;ldquo;Joe Biden has been an exemplary leader on women&amp;rsquo;s issues, giving voice to them on a federal level.&amp;nbsp; Obama&amp;rsquo;s choice of Biden sends a clear message that this next administration will prioritize women and such policies as gender-based crimes, choice, domestic violence, equal pay and health care. This ticket speaks to strength and unity. I am excited and confident in this pair!&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;State Rep. Brad Witt (D-Clatskanie): &amp;quot;Joe Biden is the right partner for Barack Obama.&amp;nbsp; His many years of distinguished service to America, his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy is the kind of leadership we need.&amp;nbsp; An Obama-Biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team, and is the balanced ticket that America is looking to vote for.&amp;nbsp; It is one that promises to honor working men and women of this country.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Castillo (State Superintendant of Public Instruction): &amp;quot;Senator Obama&#039;s choice of Joe Biden for Vice President demonstrates again that he knows what kind of leadership our country needs today to move us forward. Senator Biden has had the courage to lead on a wide range of issues--foreign policy, national security, and public safety. He also knows that investing in our people through increasing access to education will create a stronger United States of America. I am excited and inspired to support Biden as the vice-presidential running mate.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;KC Hanson, Chair of the Multnomah County Democratic Party: &amp;ldquo;Joe Biden is one of the most &lt;br /&gt;astute members in Congress on foreign policy, whose experience and expertise will no doubt benefit America, but also the rest of the world.&amp;nbsp; His depth of understanding on domestic issues and foreign affairs is unmatched.&amp;nbsp; Together, Barack and Joe Biden provide the American people with the leadership they deserve.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Rev. Alcena Boozer: &amp;ldquo;The first thing I thought of was that it was an inspirational choice.&amp;nbsp; I think that &lt;br /&gt;Biden&amp;rsquo;s experience on the foreign relations committee brings good strength and compliments Obama&amp;rsquo;s strengths as well.&amp;nbsp; I watched Sen. Biden&amp;rsquo;s speech accounting for the Republicans&amp;rsquo; use of slander and dirty politics &amp;ndash; shaming it as not being the American way.&amp;nbsp; To see someonestanding up for that is helpful to bring us back to the real issues. That is the way it should be.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Michelle Singer (First American): &amp;ldquo;I am excited to know that Joe Biden has been selected as Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s Vice President.&amp;nbsp; Joe Biden certainly has vision and underscores the same message of change that Barack Obama does.&amp;nbsp; He has been a senior statesmen in the Senate, pushing the envelope and making sure there is accountability and transparency in our government, but also holding both sides of the aisle accountable for their actions and making sure that all folks are able to share the American dream. Because of his expertise on foreign policy, intelligence, arms control, and national security, he has been there for our nation&amp;rsquo;s veterans, and those fighting on the front lines -- all along with empowering the grass roots. I am very happy with this choice.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Liz Kauffman (Oregon delegate): &amp;ldquo;The Obama-Biden team is a perfect balance and forward looking leadership for our country.&amp;nbsp; I am so excited to support this ticket, which offers fresh new leadership and escape from four more years of Bush -- and a thoughtful seriousness about the challenges we face and how to take them on!&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Charlie Burr (Environmental Activist) &amp;ldquo;Joe Biden understands that investing in clean energy makes America safer and more secure. And Biden will help fight for a sound energy policy that not only creates good&amp;nbsp; jobs for our country, but reduces our reliance on unstable and hostile parts of the world for our energy needs. Today&#039;s pick is a great example of the judgment and leadership that will make Obama a great president. Go Obama-Biden!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Barack Obama Has Chosen A Running Mate</title>
            <description>I have some important news that I want to make official.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;ve chosen Joe Biden to be my running mate. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Joe and I will appear for the first time as running mates this afternoon in Springfield, Illinois -- the same place this campaign began more than 19 months ago. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;m excited about hitting the campaign trail with Joe, but the two of us can&#039;t do this alone. We need your help to keep building this movement for change. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please let Joe know that you&#039;re glad he&#039;s part of our team. Share your personal welcome note and we&#039;ll make sure he gets it: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for your support, &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Barack&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHICAGO &lt;/strong&gt; - Today, the Obama campaign released a new 30-second TV ad, Seven, discussing just how out of touch John McCain is with the struggles of everyday people. The ad highlight&#039;s John McCain&#039;s desire to just offer more of the same economic policies we&#039;ve gotten from President Bush, as just yesterday he declared &amp;quot;the fundamentals of our economy are strong&amp;quot; and lost track of how many houses he owns.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/vpmFd25tRqo&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;rel=0&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/vpmFd25tRqo&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;rel=0&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;</description>

            <title>Oregon Campaign Staff Discuss Strategy With Press</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OBAMA CAMPAIGN LAYS OUT OREGON AS MAJOR PART OF NATIONAL STRATEGY TOWARD VICTORY &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;   &lt;em&gt;  Sen. Wyden &amp;amp; Senior Staff Release Details On Obama&#039;s Campaign for Change Structure, Outreach and Field Plan &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;  PORTLAND, OR &lt;/strong&gt;- U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden and Obama for America Oregon State Director Rob Hill held a conference call with reporters today to discuss the campaign&#039;s strategy for victory in Oregon. &lt;br /&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;     &amp;quot;The Obama campaign believes that Oregon is central to our ability to win the presidency,&amp;quot; said Hill.  &amp;quot;Historically, Oregon has been closer in presidential elections than its neighboring states. In 2004, Kerry went into Election Day with an eight point lead and won by only four percent.  In 2000, Gore won by less than one percent of the vote. We are expecting a very close race in Oregon and we are going to fight hard.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;    Read the full press release &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/orpr/&quot;&gt; here &lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  A win in Oregon this year will be an absolutely critical aspect of winning the presidency on November 4th, and the the time has never been better to get involved in your community to help make sure Barack Obama brings change to the White House.  Thousands of Oregonians have already volunteered.  Now is your chance to get involved in this historic campaign.  You can help Barack from the comfort of your home using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/votercontact&quot;&gt; Neighbor to Neighbor tool &lt;/a&gt;. Or visit any &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/oroffices/&quot;&gt; Campaign for Change office &lt;/a&gt; to find out &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/orvolunteers&quot;&gt; how you can help &lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Beaverton Volunteer Has A Big Night</title>
            <description>On Monday, August 12th, a Barack Obama supporter may have set a new world record.  Well, maybe not a new world record, but Kathryn Olson can certainly say she had a productive night.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kathryn is participating in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/orinternship&quot;&gt; internship program &lt;/a&gt; at the Beaverton Campaign For Change office.  It isn&#039;t unusual to find her in the office making hours of call each day, talking to voters in Washington county about why she supports Barack Obama and why she thinks he is the best candidate for President.  But on this particular day, Kathryn sat down at 4pm and didn&#039;t leave her chair until after 9pm, talking to almost one hundred Oregonians about what compels her to volunteer for Senator Obama, and sharing her personal story while listening to their stories.  It is people like Kathryn that make this movement what it is, a grassroots effort in towns and communities across America, a group of individuals inspired to work towards a common goal of hope and change, and with a vision of a better tomorrow for all of us.  Congratulations, Kathryn.  And thanks to all the volunteers and supporters who work so hard to make this movement what it is: to respect, empower, and include. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not everybody has hours of time each day to help out. But it only takes a little time to make a big change. &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/orvolunteers&quot;&gt; Sign up to volunteer &lt;/a&gt; for Barack Obama in &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/oroffices/&quot;&gt; your community &lt;/a&gt;. Change can&#039;t happen without you. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Barack Obama&#039;s Campaign for Change Gets a New Home in Salem</title>
            <description>Yesterday, Oregon welcomed three new Campaign for Change offices to the state.  To celebrate this occasion, offices in Medford, Corvallis, and Salem had open houses to let these communities know how the Campaign is working in their area, and how supporters and first-time volunteers can lend a hand.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Patrick New, the organizer for Salem, welcomed folks into the office Saturday morning.  Salem supporters have been working tirelessly to see that Senator Obama becomes the next President for months now, going back even before the Oregon primary, and this event provided an opportunity for supporters to get to know one another.  It was also a  chance to hear the strategy being put in place to secure a win in November, and to share ideas on how the grassroots activism that has been the foundation of Barack Obama&#039;s campaign will bring about the change people across Oregon are working hard for.  To that end, over a third of the almost one hundred attendees spent part of the day canvassing their communities, talking to their neighbors about Senator Obama, before returning for snacks, a raffle, and to place their completed packets on the Canvassing Wall of Fame.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Now is the time to get involved, and there are plenty of ways to lend a hand.  There are &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/oroffices/&quot;&gt; offices &lt;/a&gt; across Oregon, and it only takes a few hours to help bring Change to Oregon and to this country.  Sign up &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/orvolunteers&quot;&gt; here &lt;/a&gt; , and become a part of this historical campaign.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;object width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/Fzh0p5XD&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;transparent&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/Fzh0p5XD&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;</description>

            <title>New TV Ad on Obama&#039;s New Energy Plan for America</title>
            <description>&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/QJPo5IGTd0A&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/QJPo5IGTd0A&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Obama&#039;s comprehensive New Energy for America plan will: &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
-Provide short&amp;#8208;term relief to American families facing pain at the pump &lt;br /&gt;
-Help create five million new jobs by strategically investing $150 billion over the next ten years to catalyze private efforts to build a clean energy future. &lt;br /&gt;
-Within 10 years save more oil than we currently import from the Middle East and Venezuela combined. &lt;br /&gt;
-Put 1 million Plug&amp;#8208;In Hybrid cars - cars that can get up to 150 miles per gallon - on the road by 2015, cars that we will work to make sure are built here in America. &lt;br /&gt;
-Ensure 10 percent of our electricity comes from renewable sources by 2012, and 25 percent by 2025. &lt;br /&gt;
-Implement an economy&amp;#8208;wide cap&amp;#8208;and&amp;#8208;trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Find out more about Senator Obama&#039;s New Energy for America plan &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/newenergy&quot;&gt; here &lt;/a&gt;.</description>

            <title>The Campaign for Change Opens its Doors in Oregon City</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt; Last Thursday, July 24th, Oregon City welcomed the Campaign for Change to town.  While Organizers and Fellows have been working with the local communities for several weeks, Thursday marked the grand opening. Clackamas Country has a warm spot in its heart for Senator Obama, and the office was brimming with energy as community members enjoyed lively conversation, delicious food, and took pictures with a special guest Senator. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; Local Democratic leaders Jill Thorn and Cindi Lewis-Wolfram gave supporters impassioned speeches about how Clackamas county was going to help Barack Obama win in Oregon, and make sure he&#039;s sitting in the White House in 2009.  State Director Rob Hill said a few words to the crowd as well, thanking them for their support and asking for their help in the days between now and November 4th. &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;This Monday is Barack&#039;s 47th birthday.  Monday also means there wil be exactly three months until Election Day.  This weekend, you can give Barack a gift he&#039;ll always remember: your time, energy, and passion by attending a Campaign for Change event and growing our movement. Find an event in your area by clicking &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/oregonbaracksbirthday/&quot;&gt; here &lt;/a&gt;.  If you can&#039;t make it this weekend, don&#039;t worry: &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/orvolunteers&quot;&gt; volunteer opportunities &lt;/a&gt; are going on daily across Oregon.

            <title>NE Portland Campaign for Change Office Opens With Style</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt; Last Thursday, the place to be in N/NE Portland was 1516 NE Killingsworth St.  That&#039;s the location of the new Campaign for Change office, and several hundred supporters turned up for BBQ, community, and to share their passion for Senator Obama and bringing Change to Oregon.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/NE%20Portland%20Office8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;299&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/NE%20Portland%20Office12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;260&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/NE%20Portland%20Office.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;260&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt; The crowd listened as special guests Shirley Minor and Jeff Merkley laid out the course for how supporters can help both campaigns in the coming months.  The crowd took their words to heart and, in addition to consuming over 70lbs of ribs (served up courtesy of Master Chef Mr. LC Oddie), supporters old and new signed up for over 250 new volunteer shifts.  Can you find a few hours between now and November 4th to help &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/orvolunteers&quot;&gt; bring Change to your community &lt;/a&gt;?  Thanks to Scott Batchelar and Ethan Jewett for the great photos. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/NE%20Portland%20Office20.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;299&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/NE%20Portland%20Office21.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;299&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/NE%20Portland%20Office3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;295&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/2699841755_4ae9e2c4d2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/2699844631_c4f9bb2f82.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;332&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/2700655826_5c904715f4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;332&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/NE%20Portland%20Office27.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;260&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/NE%20Portland%20Office13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;260&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/NE%20Portland%20Office7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;260&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/NE%20Portland%20Office31.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;260&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/2699842535_32b87c7f39.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/NE%20Portland%20Office26.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;299&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt; Did you know it&#039;s Barack&#039;s Birthday this Monday, August 4th?

            <title>Beaverton and the Campaign For Change</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday, Beaverton welcomed the Campaign for Change to Washington county with the official &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/oroffices/&quot;&gt; office &lt;/a&gt; opening potluck.&amp;nbsp; Over 300 supporters stopped by to take part in the festivities and find out how they could help bring real change to their community and make Barack Obama the next President of the United States.&amp;nbsp; Field Organizers Caleb Hayes and Alejandro Hoekstra have been hard at work engaging with the community in voter registration drives for several weeks, and the opening part gave supporters a chance to hear how the Campaign is active in Washington county and across Oregon.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/Beaverton%20Front%20with%20Staff.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/Beaverton%20Making%20Signs.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; Supporter Astrid Harmon describes the event: &amp;quot;People from all backgrounds came to celebrate and over 100 signed up to volunteer. The excitement and enthusiasm even translated to the street, where hundreds of cars honked and gave a thumbs up to the Obama volunteers waving signs.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/Beaverton%20Crowd%204.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The crowd listened as special guests State Senator Suzanne Bonamici and State Representative Larry Galizio spoke.  &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Last Thursday, Campaign for Change offices opened their doors across Oregon.&amp;nbsp; Amongst the five new Campaign offices that hosted potlucks that day was Eugene&amp;rsquo;s own. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/Oregon/Pics/Eugene2.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/Oregon/Pics/Euguene%20opening1.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;335&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staff, Fellows, and volunteers welcomed over 500 supporters into the space at &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=150+West+Broadway,+eugene,+or&amp;amp;sll=44.059111,-121.312432&amp;amp;sspn=0.009036,0.013862&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=16&amp;amp;iwloc=addr&quot;&gt; 150 West Broadway &lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The festivities showed the sort of energy and community that Obama supporters across Oregon bring to this Campaign for Change, the sort of energy that will undoubtedly continue all the way up to November 4th. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/Oregon/Pics/Euguene%20opening9.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/Oregon/Pics/Euguene%20opening8.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/Oregon/Pics/Euguene%20opening12.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/Oregon/Pics/Euguene%20opening13.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/Oregon/Pics/Euguene%20opening7.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Local supporters came and shared in the potluck, and listened to special guests State Senator Floyd Prozanski and Susan Castillo, State Superintendent of Public Instructions.&amp;nbsp; The event was capped off when supporters were invited to dip their hands in white paint and make their mark on the Hope Wall.&amp;nbsp; This personalized touch symbolized how the Campaign for Change is a part of supporters, and they a part of it.&amp;nbsp; These dedicated volunteers are what makes this Campaign unique, and their work, and the work of folks across Oregon, is the instrument that will bring Change to Washington. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/Oregon/Pics/Euguene%20opening10.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/Oregon/Pics/Euguene%20opening11.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/Oregon/Pics/Euguene%20opening15.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/Oregon/Pics/Euguene%20opening16.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/Oregon/Pics/Euguene%20opening18.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;335&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/page/-/Oregon/Pics/Euguene%20opening19.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;335&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Change cannot happen without &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp; sign up &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/orvolunteerask&quot;&gt; here &lt;/a&gt; to help out in Oregon.&amp;nbsp; Click &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/oroffices/&quot;&gt; here &lt;/a&gt; to find an office near you, and become a part of the Campaign for Change.

            <title>Introducing Neighbor to Neighbor</title>
            <description>In keeping with the theme of empowering and including people across the United States, Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s Campaign for Change in Oregon is about to introduce a revolutionary new tool to the supporters and grassroots activists across the state. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s called Neighbor to Neighbor, or &amp;ldquo;N2N&amp;rdquo;, and it is just what it sounds like: a tool for supporters to reach out to their neighbors with Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s message of change.&amp;nbsp; The N2N program allows anyone with internet access and a will to contact people in their immediate community to get out and knocking on doors the very day they signup.&amp;nbsp; And because nobody knows your neighborhood better than you, who better to contact the people who make up your community?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Canvassing has been proven to be the most effective way of contacting voters.&amp;nbsp; What is going to be a more compelling contact for the average person: an email or phonecall from a source you might not know be familiar with, or having a smiling face that you may recognize at your door, a volunteer taking time out of their lives to talk to you about a cause they believe in?&amp;nbsp; Neighbor-to-Neighbor has the potential to bring this level of familiarity in organizing to communities, this shared and intimate knowledge of an area on the smallest and most distinct level, on a scale that has never been seen before. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting started is simple; just signup at My.BarackObama.com, or click on &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/votercontact&quot;&gt; the Neighbor-to-Neighbor link &lt;/a&gt;featured at the top of the Oregon page, OR.BarackObama.com.&amp;nbsp; From there, interested parties will be given a brief video tutorial on canvassing, instruction on how to use the N2N tool, and how to report the results of their work.&amp;nbsp; First time users can be out knocking doors and interacting with their neighbors within an hour.&amp;nbsp; And, because N2N users have the convenience of making their own, personal canvassing packets at their fingertips, you can decide when you have the time to go canvassing.&amp;nbsp; Sharing your enthusiasm for Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s Campaign for Change has never been simpler. &amp;nbsp;</description>

            <title>Grand Opening of the Campaign for Change in Oregon</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Sunday the Obama &amp;ldquo;Campaign for Change&amp;rdquo; headquarters in Portland held its grand opening and supporters turned out en masse to  sign up to &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/orvolunteers&quot;&gt; volunteer &lt;/a&gt; and meet their local staff and fellow Obama supporters.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/Oregon/Pics/IMG_0189.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt; Oregonians filled several conference tables with freshly prepared dishes for the introductory potluck, and enjoyed conversation with Obama for America and Merkley for U.S. Senate supporters of all stripes.  You can see more pictures of the event &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/barackobamadotcom/sets/72157606163746694/&quot;&gt; here. &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/Oregon/Pics/IMG_0043.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;475&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/Oregon/Pics/IMG_0162.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/Oregon/Pics/IMG_0163.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt; Multnomah county Field Organizer Erin Devaney spoke first to the crowd, sharing her personal campaign story, and asked everyone to find a few extra hours in their lives between now and November 4th to spend for change -- an hour &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/orvolunteers&quot;&gt; canvassing &lt;/a&gt;, an hour &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/orvolunteers&quot;&gt; phonebanking &lt;/a&gt;, an hour &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/orvolunteers&quot;&gt; registering voters &lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;-- and to inscribe that commitment on yellow notes that were circulated around the room. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/Oregon/Pics/IMG_0194.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/Oregon/Pics/IMG_0170.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/Oregon/Pics/IMG_0146.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Former Oregon governor Barbara Roberts, the special guest of the evening, took the microphone to a resounding ovation. Roberts asked the crowd not to find themselves wishing they could have done more on November 5th. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/Oregon/Pics/IMG_0120.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;p&gt; Barbara Roberts implored supporters and volunteers to give their all in the coming months to assure Barack Obama is elected the next President of the United States. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Reach out and become a part of this historical movement &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/orvolunteers&quot;&gt; here &lt;/a&gt;, and those who have so graciously dedicated their time in the past can help in these final months &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/orvolunteers&quot;&gt; here &lt;/a&gt;.  More &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/oroffices/&quot;&gt; offices &lt;/a&gt; will be opening in towns across across Oregon soon, and dedicated supporters continue to reach out to their communities and organize events  through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybarackobama.com/&quot;&gt; MyBarackObama &lt;/a&gt; tool.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/Oregon/Pics/IMG_0131.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/Oregon/Pics/IMG_0075.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/Oregon/Pics/IMG_0179.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/Oregon/Pics/IMG_0177.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt; Do you have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=barack+obama&quot;&gt; pictures &lt;/a&gt; or stories about &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/event/search_simple&quot;&gt; events &lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/orvolunteers&quot;&gt; volunteer activities &lt;/a&gt; in your area? &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/orstory&quot;&gt; Share them with us here &lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Fourth of July in Oregon</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;People from across Oregon came out to celebrate our nation&#039;s Independence Day, and Obama supporters were out in droves. They marched in parades from Ashland to Astoria, attending backyard BBQs in Portland and Corvallis, and continued &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/orvolunteers&quot;&gt; voter registration &lt;/a&gt; drives all across the state. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/Oregon/Pics/iraqvietnamkoreavets.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/Oregon/Pics/koreaandiraqvets.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt; One supporter and veteran marched in an Ashland Parade alongside veterans of the Korean, Vietnam, and Iraq wars, as well as civilians. Thanks, Jay, for the pictures! &amp;nbsp;And thank you to the men and women who serve and who have served to keep America free!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/Oregon/Pics/obamacrew.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/Oregon/Pics/hopecrowd.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you have photos from your Fourth of July Obama event you&#039;d like to share?  &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/orstory&quot;&gt; Send them &lt;/a&gt; our way!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; Voter registration efforts will continue throughout the fall.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/orvolunteers&quot;&gt; Sign up &lt;/a&gt; to help today</description>

            <title>Obama Fellows: &quot;These are folks with a sense of mission and purpose&quot;</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;With the general election just over four months away, staff and volunteers across the country are preparing for a true &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1813397,00.html&quot;&gt;50 state campaign&lt;/a&gt;. Last week, 3600 newly trained &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/fellowshome&quot;&gt;Obama Organizing Fellows&lt;/a&gt; were deployed to nearly two dozen states. On Tuesday, eleven Fellows arrived at the Jackson County Democratic Headquarters in Oregon. Local &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blueoregon.com/2008/06/eleven-obama-fe.html&quot;&gt;Blue Oregon&lt;/a&gt; blogger Paulie Brading was on hand to welcome them:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jackson County Democratic joint is jumping!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NYC Obama field representative in charge of his flock is fresh off a tour of duty in Iraq. We met a college student from Boston College, a journalist from Virginia, a retired teacher from CA, students from AZ, VA, CA and an ER doc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... They are here to register new voters, hold house parties, and to build an even bigger group of Obama volunteers before they leave in six weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We oriented the Obama fellows by providing thumbnail sketches of our precincts, voting behavior, number of volunteers already in the data bank, and our outreach to the newly registered 7,500+ Democrats in Jackson County. The fellows were challenged to make Jackson County majority BLUE. We are only 3% points away from making certain that Jackson County is no longer regarded as a Republican stronghold. Then we handed over the keys to the front and back door to the field representative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not giddy volunteers for Obama enjoying an excellent adventure far from their homes ... These are folks with a sense of mission and purpose. Yesterday, after driving from Portland they began phone banking and attended an organizational meeting for Veterans for Obama in the evening arranged by the Jackson County Democrats. Just another 12 hour day one volunteer told me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the Fellows will be focused on helping supporters organize June 28th &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/uniteforchange/&quot;&gt;Unite For Change&lt;/a&gt; events and &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/vfchome&quot;&gt;voter registration&lt;/a&gt;. But as Blue Oregon alluded to, the long-term goal of the Fellows program is to help grow our pool of volunteers even larger for the work ahead. We need volunteers with all different skills and backgrounds in every corner of the country. No matter where you are, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://action.barackobama.com/page/s/volunteer/&quot;&gt;sign up to volunteer now&lt;/a&gt;, and you&#039;ll be contacted as needs arise in your community.  &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Networks Declare Obama Winner in Oregon</title>
            <description>Thank you Oregon!  Although polls just &quot;closed&quot; around the state -- and many ballots have yet to be counted -- Barack Obama has been declared the winner of the Democratic primary in Oregon.  Check &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/primaries/results/state/#val=OR&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for county-by-county results as they become available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is also clear that Sen. Obama has taken an absolute majority of the pledged delegates in the nomination battle tonight.  This crucial milestone brings us one step closer to winning the Democratic nomination.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We couldn&#039;t have accomplished this victory in Oregon without you.  From our dedicated volunteers to the thousands of Oregonians who stood up at events and rallies across the state demanding change, this victory is truly yours.  Thank you very much for your support!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Video: Barack Obama in Portland, OR</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;What more needs to be said about yesterday&#039;s rally? One in fifty Oregonians crowded the lawn and surrounding streets of Waterfront Park. We&#039;ve shown you pictures, news clippings and headlines, now we bring you our video of the afternoon&#039;s event. Enjoy:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;355&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/RZ4XsemlDP4&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;transparent&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/RZ4XsemlDP4&amp;amp;hl=en&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;355&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballots are due in less than 33 hours and there are still lots of undecided voters out there. Help us out by calling your fellow Oregonians and letting them know that Obama is the best candidate to bring change to Washington, D.C.!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/contact/splash/callor&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/blog/MakeCalls.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>&#039;Portland Wows Obama&#039;</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s what the people of Portland saw when they picked up the paper this morning:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/blog/OregonianRally.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is the deadline for Oregon voters to turn in their ballots. All ballots must be delivered to a County Elections Office or an &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/orlookup/&quot;&gt;official drop location&lt;/a&gt; by 8:00 PM on Tuesday. Right now, grassroots phonebankers across the country are &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/contact/splash/callor&quot;&gt;calling Oregon voters&lt;/a&gt; to let supporters know how and where to turn in their ballots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After yesterday, there&#039;s no question that Oregon is fired up and ready for change. Over the next 24 hours, you can help make sure that every Oregon voter has a chance to take part in this historic moment . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/contact/splash/callor&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/blog/MakeCalls.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>More Scenes from Portland</title>
            <description>&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2173/2504270546_5188217528_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/news/politics/blog/2008/05/obama_record_75000_in_portland.html&quot;&gt;Baltimore &lt;em&gt;Sun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crowd covers the lawn here at Tom McCall Waterfront Park, from the streetside entry gates down to the Willamette River. Portland fire officials estimate 60,000 people are packed inside the park proper and another 10-15,000 are watching outside the gates. Spectators are lining the bridge behind Obama and watching, bikini-clad, from boats on the river.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;... At one point, someone in the crowd shouted an expression of love at Obama. He broke his speech for a moment: &amp;quot;I love you too,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you vote for me on Tuesday,&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;We won&#039;t just win Oregon. We&#039;ll win this nomination, we&#039;ll win this general election. And you and I together, we&#039;ll change this country, we&#039;ll change the world.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventy-five thousand people seemed to like the sound of that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2010/2504271714_d92a62633c_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2042/2503438705_c22cf79b6b_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Portland Rally: &quot;Wow, wow, wow&quot;</title>
            <description>&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/blog/Portland75K02.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More from Portland, via the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oregonlive.com/newsflash/index.ssf?/base/elections-0/1211157248128230.xml&amp;amp;storylist=orlocal&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under skies that obligingly turned from habitual gray to clear blue, Democratic presidential front-runner Barack Obama on Sunday drew the largest crowd of his 15-month marathon campaign for the presidency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sixty-thousand people packed into a park alongside the banks of the Willamette River to listen to Obama, with another 15,000 left standing outside the gates, according to city fire officials. Hundreds more anchored their motorboats, or floated in kayaks and canoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ... Even after months on the trail, Obama seemed slightly stunned by the size of the crowd, saying &amp;quot;Wow, wow, wow&amp;quot; as he surveyed the audience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;rtbb2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;We have had a lot of rallies,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;This is the most spectacular setting, the most spectacular crowd we have had this entire campaign.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;c5tn0&quot;&gt;In August of 2004, then-Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry held a large rally in the same location, drawing about 45,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;c5tn1&quot;&gt;But on Sunday, Obama topped that without even being the official nominee, speaking to a crowd filled with sunscreen-smeared babies in sun hats, union members in matching T-shirts, elderly ladies fanning themselves under the hot sun and twenty-somethings dancing to his opening act, the Portland-based band The Decemberists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;c5tn2&quot;&gt;Some voters lined up before dawn to see him, including Michelle Kay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;c5tn3&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;We are all so sick of Bush, his lies, the war,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;When Obama came out he was so honest, so refreshing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;c5tn4&quot;&gt;Others arrived at the last minute, such as Afang Tang-Christianson of Beaverton and her husband Daniel. She is due to give birth to twins in the next week or two, and the two had spent the morning at the hospital when she began feeling early contractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after leaving, she said they came straight to the rally, adding, &amp;quot;It&#039;s all about a new beginning, a new start. We are really hoping for change in Washington.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Largest Crowd Yet: 75,000 Rally in Portland</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;For hours now, we&#039;ve been seeing stories about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kgw.com/sharedcontent/APStories/stories/D90O9B7G0.html&quot;&gt;huge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.oregonlive.com/elections/2008/05/want_to_see_obama_get_in_line.html&quot;&gt;lines&lt;/a&gt; for today&#039;s outdoor rally at Waterfront Park in Portland, Oregon. It&#039;s now been confirmed that the actual crowd on hand topped 75,000 people (60,000 inside the gates of Waterfront Park, with another 15,000 outside). Here is what the largest crowd yet of this Presidential campaign looks like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/blog/Portland75K.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATED:&lt;/strong&gt; From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/&quot;&gt;Washington &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The sea of heads stretches for half a mile along the grassy embankment, while others watch from kayaks and power boats bobbing on the Willamette River. More hug the rails of the steel bridge that stretches across the water and crowds are even watching from jetties on the opposite shore. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past fifteen months, you&#039;ve helped us build an incredible movement unlike anything that has ever been seen before. But this is only the beginning. We still have a long road ahead and much work to do, but you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://donate.barackobama.com/page/contribute/standard?source=HQblog&quot;&gt;contribute now&lt;/a&gt; to help us seize this moment, and continue this momentum, all the way to November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://donate.barackobama.com/page/contribute/standard?source=HQblog&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.barackobama.com/images/177_donate.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Barack Obama: &quot;This is a defining moment&quot;</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;With the state&#039;s primary just a few days away, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.statesmanjournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080518/OPINION/805180314/1049&quot;&gt; Oregon &lt;em&gt;Statesman Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; invited the Democratic presidential candidates to submit guest opinions answering this question: &amp;quot;What is your plan for Oregon? In other words, why should Oregon Democrats pick you as the best candidate for president and what would your nomination mean to Oregon?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This morning&#039;s edition of the paper included Barack Obama&#039;s response:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a defining moment. At a time when our nation is at war and our American dream is slipping away, we cannot settle for the status quo. In this election, Oregon can stand for change. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#039;ve spent more than two decades working for change from the bottom up. I fought for jobs as an organizer in Chicago when the local steel plant closed. I stood up as a civil-rights lawyer for people who were denied opportunity. I helped expand health care to hundreds of thousands and gave a tax cut to working people in Illinois. I opposed this war in Iraq from the beginning, and when I got to Washington I stood up to the special interests to help pass the most far-reaching lobbying reform since Watergate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I chose to run for president because I believe that the size of our challenges had outgrown the capacity of our broken politics to solve them. We cannot afford four more years of the same divisive fights in Washington that are more about scoring points than solving problems. We&#039;re not going to make progress if we continue to have a system driven by special interests. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We need to restore fairness to our economy. When I&#039;m president, we&#039;ll give a tax cut to 1.8 million hardworking Oregonians and help struggling families keep their homes. We&#039;ll ensure that the 615,000 Oregonians who currently lack health insurance are covered and cut the cost of a typical family&#039;s premiums by as much as $2,500 per year. We&#039;ll create a $4,000 annual tax credit to help Oregon students cope with tuitions that have increased 27.5 percent since 1999. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; And we&#039;ll turn the page on more than two decades of trade and economic policies that have favored Wall Street over Main Street. It&#039;s time to stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas and start giving them to companies that create jobs here at home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Oregon has been a national leader in energy independence, passing a renewable portfolio standard, auto-emissions rules and incentives for biofuels development. I will build on Oregon&#039;s successes to move America on the path to a cleaner environment. I will devote $150 billion over 10 years to move us toward energy independence and invest in the green energy jobs of the future. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Oregon deserves a president who understands the unique environmental challenges facing the state. That&#039;s why I will develop a meaningful plan to restore decimated salmon stocks with the advice of all stakeholders, including fishers, farmers, tribes, environmentalists and foresters. That&#039;s why I will ensure that Oregonians have a say about whether and where we place onshore liquefied natural gas facilities in the state. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; That&#039;s why I support county timber payments and will work with the Oregon congressional delegation to find a comprehensive, long-term solution that will provide Oregon communities the resources they need to invest in a strong education system and create a sustainable economy. And that&#039;s why I will work with Oregonians to develop a common-sense plan to conserve Oregon&#039;s woodlands. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Oregon knows we need less tough talk and more sound judgment on national security. When I am president, I will end a war in Iraq that I opposed from the start, give our troops and military families the support they have earned, and finish the fight in Afghanistan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With a father from Kenya and a mother from Kansas, I know that my story is only possible in America. My family didn&#039;t have much when I was growing up, but they gave me love, a good education and hope &amp;mdash; hope that in this country, no dream is beyond our grasp if we reach for it, and fight for it, and work for it. And the reason I&#039;m running for president is to put the American dream within reach for every family in Oregon and in this country. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Barack Obama&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Oregon primary is conducted entirely through mail-in ballot, and although it is now too late to mail ballots, many supporters may not realize that they can still turn their ballots at their county elections office or &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/orlookup/&quot;&gt;designated drop sites&lt;/a&gt;. Right now, grassroots phonebankers across the country are &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/contact/splash/callor&quot;&gt;calling Oregon supporters&lt;/a&gt; to let them know how to find their ballot drop off locations, and how they too can be part of this historic, defining moment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/contact/splash/callor&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/blog/MakeCalls.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They understand that the best way to bring about change is by banding together and convincing those around you that the way things are, aren&#039;t the way things need to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3177/2499142761_341c6141a9.jpg?v=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take action today.

            <title>Oregon&#039;s Time is Now!</title>
            <description>Good morning, Oregon!&amp;nbsp; The temperature in Portland today is expected to be in the upper 90&#039;s and I attribute that to all of Oregon getting fired up about this weekend!&amp;nbsp; Senator Obama will be joining us in Rosenburg on Saturday morning, and Sunday brings him to Portland and Pendleton.&amp;nbsp; Details of the events are right above the blog.&amp;nbsp; If you live in these areas, tell all your undecided friends, family, and neighbors to join you there. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow morning begins our last big weekend canvass.&amp;nbsp; It&#039;s our last chance to make sure people are turning their ballots in.&amp;nbsp; We have several resources available to help everyone cast their ballots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The deadline to mail in your ballot has passed.&amp;nbsp; If you need to know where to bring your ballot, &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/orlookup/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/orlookup/&quot;&gt;use our lookup tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/orgotv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/orgotv&quot;&gt;Sign up for a canvass shift.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; Now that your ballot is in, make sure everyone in your neighborhood has theirs in as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you&#039;re on a college campus, feel free to use our &lt;a href=&quot;http://or.barackobama.com/orride&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;http://or.barackobama.com/orride&quot;&gt;Yes We Van! service&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; This shuttle will take you from campus to your ballot drop location.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com&quot;&gt;my.barackobama.com&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; There are always events going on in your community, organized by your neighbors, and many this weekend have to do with ballot collection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we do the hard work that Senator Obama needs us to do this weekend, we could deliver enough delegates to give him the pledged delegate majority on Tuesday night.&amp;nbsp; If that happens, you can be assured that this weekend will not be the last Oregon has seen of Barack Obama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#039;s a video of Barack&#039;s last swing through the Beaver State.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;355&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/TG7rIzZoKeo&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;transparent&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/TG7rIzZoKeo&amp;amp;hl=en&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;355&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;</description>

            <title>Message from Barack: Where we stand in Oregon</title>
            <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://or.barackobama.com/ORgotv&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.barackobama.com/images/email/gotv/or_gotv_e.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;  I&#039;m headed back to Oregon this weekend, and I wanted to take a moment to let you know where we stand in this race. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As I&#039;ve traveled across Oregon, I&#039;ve spoken to veterans, students, and hard-working families about the challenges middle-class America is facing &amp;mdash; and about how we&#039;re going to start solving them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve seen the excitement on the ground, and I truly believe Oregon is ready to stand up for a different kind of politics &amp;mdash; but only if you take ownership of this effort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This weekend &amp;mdash; and especially Monday and Tuesday &amp;mdash; supporters across the state are going door-to-door to make sure as many people as possible turn in their ballots by the May 20th deadline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s not too late to get involved &amp;mdash; even if you&#039;ve never participated in politics before.&lt;a href=&quot;http://or.barackobama.com/ORgotv&quot;&gt; Sign up to help Get Out The Vote in Oregon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  I don&#039;t need to tell you how many people are paying attention to this primary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They know how far we&#039;ve traveled together, but they want to know when we&#039;ll close out this race, secure the nomination, and finally bring about the change our country so desperately needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can bring jobs back to communities across the country, reduce the price of gas, and put an end to the war in Iraq &amp;mdash; but we need to finish strong in Oregon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In these next four days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://or.barackobama.com/ORgotv&quot;&gt; Sign up to Get Out The Vote before May 20th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let&#039;s go change America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; Barack&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Few people in this country have more campaign experience than Max Kennedy.&amp;nbsp; He was just three years old when his father, Robert Kennedy, ran for President.&amp;nbsp; Yesterday at Portland State University he joined actor Dul&amp;eacute; Hill, best known for playing the role of Charles Young on this blogger&#039;s favorite show, The West Wing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3222/2496127820_314c58999a.jpg?v=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3019/2495303571_84d11ed41a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An overflow crowd of students and others gathered in the Smith Memorial Student Union to hear Dul&amp;eacute; and Max say why they support Senator Obama for President.&amp;nbsp; Here&#039;s a video:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;355&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/ZGyeVYGmPXw&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;transparent&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/ZGyeVYGmPXw&amp;amp;hl=en&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;355&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max Kennedy knows what it takes to win an election.&amp;nbsp; There are now less than six days to turn in your ballots for Barack Obama and to get your neighbors and friends to do the same.&amp;nbsp; Sign up for a canvassing shift today you&#039;ll be able to say you helped change this county.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>The Boys of Bend</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;This past weekend Senator Obama wrapped up his trip through Oregon in Bend.&amp;nbsp; The residents were more than excited to see a leading Presidential candidate in their area for the first time in twenty years.&amp;nbsp; Even more exciting is the chance for Oregon to make history next week.&amp;nbsp; With enough hard work over the next seven days, Oregon can put Senator Obama over the finish line and give him enough delegates to clinch the pledged delegate majority!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In attendance at the town hall were Larry, Wayne, David, and Jim, all from Central Oregon.&amp;nbsp; They stopped by our office in Bend after the event and discussed why they feel Senator Obama is the candidate to bring real change to Washington D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;350&quot;&gt; &lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/T9hfDT4wFUs&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;  &lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/T9hfDT4wFUs&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;  &lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#039;re one week away from the voting deadline! We&#039;ll win in Oregon the same way we won around the country: knocking on doors, making phone calls, talking with our neighbors, friends, and family about Senator Obama&#039;s vision of unity and his plan to turn this country around.</description>

            <title>Congressman Peter DeFazio (D-OR) Endorses Obama</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;What better time to roll out a couple more endorsements than as we welcome Senator Obama back to the Beaver State!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://associatedpress.com/media/images/logo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) - The movement of Democratic superdelegates to presidential hopeful Barack Obama gained steam Friday, with endorsements expected from two more congressmen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obama spokesman Dan Pfeiffer said the Illinois senator plans to receive the endorsement of Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon an event Friday in his homestate. Oregon holds it&#039;s primary on May 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While polling in the Oregon has been sparse, Obama is believed to hold a significant advantage over New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton. With DeFazio, he will have the endorsement of three of the state&#039;s four Democratic House members. Reps. Earl Blumenauer and David Wu earlier endorsed Obama, while Gov. Ted Kulongoski and Rep. Darlene Hooley have endorsed Clinton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In New Jersey, Donald Payne&amp;mdash;a black congressman who had been backing Clinton for the nomination&amp;mdash;is switching his support to Obama, Pfeiffer confirmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clinton won the New Jersey primary on Feb. 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;After careful consideration, I have reached the conclusion that Barack Obama can best bring about the change that our country so desperately wants and needs,&amp;quot; Payne told The Star-Ledger in Newark, N.J. It was &amp;quot;one of the most difficult decisions I have made,&amp;quot; Payne said. &amp;quot;I&#039;ve really been mulling it over for quite a while.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obama&#039;s endorsements from superdelegates has picked sharply since Tuesday, when he soundly defeated Clinton in North Carolina&#039;s primary and held her to a narrow victory in Indiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encourage any undecided friends and family members to attend one of our events today or tomorrow!&amp;nbsp; Details are on &lt;a href=&quot;http://or.barackobama.com&quot; title=&quot;Oregon for Obama&quot;&gt;our Oregon homepage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>What a night!</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;With a commanding victory in North Carolina and a very very very close contest in Indiana, our supporters in both of those states as well as all Americans who want to put an end to the divisive politics of the the past should be proud.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Our work is not done, Oregon! &amp;nbsp;There are doors to knock and minds to inspire. &amp;nbsp;Tonight gives you a strong argument for why Senator Obama is the best candidate in this race. The talking heads said Barack Obama would get crushed in Indiana because of an alleged problem with working class voters. But the reality is that Obama erased Clinton&amp;rsquo;s big lead in Indiana precisely by connecting with working people. They know that his plans for a middle class tax cut and affordable universal health care are what is going to help them most and they were not fooled by the McCain-Clinton gas tax &amp;ldquo;holiday&amp;rdquo; gimmick.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Here are the best ways to help:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; If you haven&#039;t voted, vote! &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/orlookup/&quot; title=&quot;Find your ballot drop location.&quot;&gt;Find your ballot drop location.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/orpcc_home/&quot; title=&quot;Become an Oregon Community Organizer&quot;&gt; Become an Oregon Community Organizer.&lt;/a&gt; These organizers are the backbone of our campaign.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/orhousing&quot; title=&quot;Host a volunteer&quot;&gt; Host a volunteer.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; We have great volunteers who make the drive or flight to Oregon from other states and they need a place to sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If we put our nose to the grindstone these next 2 weeks, we&#039;ll make history here in Oregon.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In case anyone missed it, here&#039;s Senator Obama&#039;s victory speech from Raleigh, NC tonight.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;355&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/Ki-oMjmwiUA&amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;transparent&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/Ki-oMjmwiUA&amp;hl=en&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; wmode=&quot;transparent&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;355&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Taking the High Road in Oregon</title>
            <description>Steve Duin of the &lt;i&gt;Oregonian&lt;/i&gt; boiled down the state of the Democratic primary in an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/steve_duin/index.ssf?/base/news/121003351944820.xml&amp;coll=7&quot;&gt;eye-opening editorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; today.  Artfully titled &quot;The high road: Better view, fewer options,&quot; Duin makes the case for one candidate in this race -- the one who&#039;s staying above the kitchen-sink fray, drawing new voters into the process, and promising the kind of bold change Oregonians demand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From today&#039;s piece:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Among the more meaningful choices Oregon voters will make this month is whether to reward Barack Obama for his restraint or Hillary Clinton for her ruinous campaigning in the Democratic primary.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If the Iranians think Clinton is kidding about &quot;total obliteration,&quot; they need only track the routine nastiness of this happy warrior in recent months. She is energized by the aroma of scorched earth, and her passion for the negative is only heightened by the smug certainty that Obama won&#039;t answer her in kind...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But Obama has suggested he&#039;s better than such exhumations, and that we are, too. He wants to believe there&#039;s more of a future in inspiring and uniting voters than in demeaning opponents. And he understands that by following Clinton down the low and divisive road, he will not only lose his advantage in the primary but sacrifice the trust of the new and idealistic voters he&#039;s recruited into the Democratic fold...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Obama has promised &quot;a new kind of politics&quot; . . . and has campaigned with a degree of sincerity, honesty and thoughtful introspection I&#039;ve never seen in a presidential candidate. I don&#039;t know if the combination will bring him victories in Tuesday&#039;s primaries, but I trust that Oregon voters -- in what DeFazio calls &quot;the first relevant primary we&#039;ve had in 24 years&quot; -- will reward him in spectacular and gratifying fashion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Balloting in Oregon&#039;s primary began last weekend and lasts through May 20th, exactly two weeks from today.  With Oregon playing such a vital role in the nominating process this year, why not &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/orcanvass7&quot;&gt;get involved with the campaign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and help put the politics of personal destruction behind us for good?</description>

            <title>Oregon and the Gas Tax</title>
            <description>It&#039;s brought up every four years.  Suspending the gas tax to give families relief at the pump.  It sounds good on its face, but when you get into the details, this is a band-aid on a broken leg.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sen. Obama knows we need relief from the tyranny of foreign oil.  The price of oil hit $120 a barrel today.  Americans have never paid more for gas and the demand for gas has never been higher.  Family budgets are being stretched every time the family car goes empty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The gas tax holiday is not the answer.  In the end you&#039;ll have saved half a gas tank&#039;s worth of money and that&#039;s if the oil companies don&#039;t raise their prices in compensation for the drop.  The money from the gas tax goes into the Federal Highway Trust Fund and this tax holiday would drain money from there, putting in jeopardy not only roads and bridges in need of repair, but the good paying jobs that go along with them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sen. Obama knows the only way we&#039;ll pay less at the pump is if we use less.  He has proposed raising fuel efficiency standards on cars, invest in alternative fuels like cellulosic ethanol, and refit our buildings to become more energy efficient.  In short, there are many reasons why the recent gas-tax suspension plan floated around by Senators John McCain and Hillary Clinton is wrong for Oregon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So what does the Oregon press think about this supposed gas-tax holiday?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bend &lt;em&gt;Bulletin&lt;/em&gt; weighed in:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Leonard Burman, a Brookings Institution economist interviewed by The Washington Post, calls the Hillary plan &amp;quot;utterly incoherent.&amp;quot; Windfall taxes of the sort she proposes, he points out, reduce oil company income. What do oil companies do with all of this income? They typically use a good chunk of it to locate and develop new sources of oil. Grabbing profits, then, ultimately reduces oil supplies, which in turn raises prices, exacerbating the very problem panderers like Clinton and McCain claim to be addressing. (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bendbulletin.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080503/OPIN01/805030325&amp;amp;template=print&quot;&gt;LINK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So sayeth the Eugene &lt;em&gt;Register-Guard&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Both Sen. John McCain and Sen. Hillary Clinton have embraced a gas tax holiday in a transparent attempt to pander to voters. Sen. Barack Obama opposes the idea. On this issue, only one presidential candidate has shown he believes Americans&#039; votes can&#039;t be bought cheaply and that citizens have the sense to understand where the nation&#039;s interests lie. (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/dt.cms.support.viewStory.cls?cid=98556&amp;amp;sid=5&amp;amp;fid=2&quot;&gt;LINK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what do bicycle-friendly Portlanders think of the idea? The &lt;em&gt;Oregonian&lt;/em&gt; was not impressed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Campaigning in North Carolina Saturday, Hillary Clinton said her disagreement with Barack Obama on the viability of the &amp;quot;gas tax holiday&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;part of a larger difference between us.&amp;quot; And that&#039;s true. Clinton will embrace anything and pander to anyone to get elected. (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.oregonlive.com/steveduin/2008/05/hillary_in_a_holiday_mood.html&quot;&gt;LINK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...and...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Sen. John McCain&#039;s idea to give Americans a summer holiday from federal gas taxes is about as weighty as a Barbie Dream Car, yet he can&#039;t stop driving it into the ground. Neither can Sen. Hillary Clinton. The two presidential contenders can&#039;t resist the chance to pander to voters and, as a bonus, paint Sen. Barack Obama as an elitist. By doing so, they&#039;re missing an opportunity to show leadership on some major long-term challenges -- such as updating the nation&#039;s crowded roads and aging bridges...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an election-year sop, not a plan for the future. Yet the millionaire senator and presumptive Republican nominee has stuck with it, using it as shorthand to call Obama -- who opposes the tax holiday -- out of touch with ordinary Americans. (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oregonlive.com/editorials/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/editorial/1209428735145040.xml&amp;amp;coll=7&quot;&gt;LINK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sen. Obama has shown true leadership on this issue by not pandering with facile soundbites and instead presenting the truth to Oregonians and the American people -- that reducing our dependence on foreign oil will require drastic steps and not quick fixes. Barack&#039;s &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barackobama.com/issues/energy/&quot;&gt;environmental plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; contains a whole host of measures aimed at developing renewable sources of energy as well as providing tax breaks to middle-class Americans.</description>

            <title>Another Endorsement as Ballots Go Out</title>
            <description>The &lt;i&gt;East Oregonian&lt;/i&gt; joined several other newspapers in Oregon yesterday by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; http://www.eastoregonian.com/main.asp?SectionID=14&amp;SubSectionID=50&amp;ArticleID=77127&amp;TM=52297.6&quot;&gt;endorsing Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in the presidential primary.  They mentioned, in part:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Barack Obama is the face of the future for America - and Oregon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He also is our unanimous choice for the Democratic presidential nominee. This from an editorial board that include Democrats, Republicans and Independents, as well as conservatives and liberals.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Why? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First and foremost, Obama brings inspiration for our state, our nation and our Earth. Inspiration has not been a part of America&#039;s political scene since John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy. It could not have come at a better time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In order to capitalize on our growing grassroots movement in the state, supporters fanned out across Oregon to begin our Get-Out-the-Vote canvassing this morning.  Ballots started arriving by mail to voters in Oregon yesterday, and they can be returned anytime up until 8pm on May 20th.  (Special note:  Secretary of State Bill Bradbury announced that some voters who switched parties may get a ballot reflecting their previous party affiliation; these people will also receive a new Democratic ballot in a few days, but should contact their local county elections office if it does not come by May 10th.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot;; src=&quot;http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c158/AnthonySF/AFSCME.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Throughout our 15 offices statewide, hundreds of volunteers stopped by today to help in the effort.  A loyal team of AFSCME members -- who broke from their national union to endorse Sen. Obama -- met in our Portland headquarters to once again demonstrate why they feel he is the strongest candidate for working-class people by spreading his message of change door-to-door.  And as we like to say in Oregon, the election started yesterday -- so get those ballots in quick!</description>

            <title>Mission Not Accomplished</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;It was five years ago today that President Bush declared major combat operations in Iraq over in his infamous &amp;quot;Mission Accomplished&amp;quot; aircraft-carrier appearance.  In order to demonstrate how little has actually been accomplished since, the Obama campaign held simultaneous press conferences today in five cities across Oregon with guest speakers discussing the misdirected priorities of the Bush Administration and reinforcing Sen. Obama&#039;s positions &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/Oregon/OregonPolicy.pdf&quot;&gt;on the issues that matter most to Oregonians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gathering at the Salem VFW addressed how our continued troop presence in Iraq has diverted attention from veterans&#039; issues back home. Similar sentiments were echoed in Bend, Eugene, and Medford press conferences, with the environment also ranking as a top priority being dangerously overlooked with our current spending priorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Portland, a panel that included former Pennsylvania Sen. Harris Wofford, state legislators Mary Nolan and Ben Westlund, Vietnam Green Beret Jim Rassman, and Woodburn Mayor Kathy Figley touched upon the enormous fiscal cost of the Iraq War -- and how billions of dollars spent overseas could have been used to fund underserved public schools or insure the thousands of Oregon children without health care.  Wofford cited Obama&#039;s commitment to bringing together coalitions to solve these problems -- and not just issuing compacts and plans -- as the reason why he strongly backs the Senator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s a video from the event in Portland:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;355&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/yXjyigk3fuk&amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;transparent&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/yXjyigk3fuk&amp;hl=en&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; wmode=&quot;transparent&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;355&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Hoops for Change</title>
            <description>Before a North Portland crowd of volunteers, local activists, and basketball fans last night, the campaign held an exciting Hoops for Change event featuring some of the biggest names in Oregon sports.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Craig Robinson, Oregon State&#039;s new men&#039;s basketball coach (who also happens to be Barack&#039;s brother-in-law), refereed a 3-on-3 game with some young Obama supporters who had collected voter registration forms over the weekend.  Participants were picked after answering a couple of Craig&#039;s Obama-centric trivia questions, such as &amp;quot;What state does Barack represent in the Senate?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;On which island did he spend his childhood?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Coaching the opposing teams were Portland Trail Blazers Channing Frye and James Jones, taking some time away from the Rose Garden to lend a hand in Barack&#039;s campaign for change.  KXL &amp;quot;voice of the Trail Blazers&amp;quot; (and former Blazer himself) Antonio Harvey did some hilarious play-by-play at the event.&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/oSCVoFCE&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;transparent&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/oSCVoFCE&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Frye&#039;s team came up short both times, but there was little disappointment among the 100 or so fans who showed up for a good time and a good cause.  Of course, pictures and autographs were part of the post-game package.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Earlier in the day, &amp;quot;Fresh Prince of Bel Air&amp;quot; actress and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjXyqcx-mYY&quot;&gt;Yes We Can&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; star Tatyana Ali made a string of campus appearances for Obama at colleges around the state.  Hitting UofO and OSU, she wrapped up the day at Portland State University on the eve of the voter registration deadline.  She encouraged students to make their voices heard in the process, and to support Sen. Obama in the May primary.&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c158/AnthonySF/Ali.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Ali cited Obama&#039;s message of hope and change for getting her first involved with the campaign.  She also discussed how having a leader who is able to &amp;quot;cross so many lines and divides&amp;quot; to inspire the American people is absolutely critical in our next president.  The voter registration period ends Tuesday, April 29th, and ballots are due by May 20th.</description>

            <title>The Oregonian: Obama best on gas taxes</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oregonlive.com/editorials/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/editorial/1209428735145040.xml&amp;amp;coll=7&quot;&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Oregonian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What a gas -- [McCain and Clinton] can&#039;t resist the chance to pander to voters and, as a bonus, paint Sen. Barack Obama as an elitist&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an election-year sop, not a plan for the future&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We agree with Obama on this issue. He calls it a short-term fix that benefits oil companies rather than consumers, and says it creates the illusion of leadership without actual change. But we also expect more from McCain, an independent thinker who rarely resorts to such political gimmicks.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of all, voters deserve better. They deserve candidates who will concede that the federal gas tax hasn&#039;t budged for 15 years -- and that the nation&#039;s roads, bridges and railways are suffering as a result. They need candidates who will look beyond the nation&#039;s borders and address the falling dollar and the global demand for oil, two factors that are far more powerful than an 18-cent tax. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, voters need candidates who will acknowledge what&#039;s at stake after the next election -- and the next summer vacation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more on Obama&#039;s energy policy, &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/HQpress/042508%20Fact%20Sheet%20Gas%20Prices%20FINAL.pdf&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Oregon Voter Registration: &quot;There&#039;s no time to procrastinate&quot;</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;From today&#039;s Oregon &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.statesmanjournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080428/OPINION/804280309/1048&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Statesman Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This year&#039;s battle-to-the-finish Democratic presidential primary has encouraged a rush of Oregon voter registrations. That&#039;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#039;t make your voice heard unless you vote, and you can&#039;t vote unless you register. Tuesday &amp;mdash; tomorrow &amp;mdash; is the deadline to do that for the May 20 primary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deadline affects mainly first-time Oregon voters, people who haven&#039;t voted in the past five years and registered voters who are changing their political party affiliation. People who have moved within Oregon may have more time, but they should call their county elections office to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Registration forms are readily available on the Internet, at Driver and Motor Vehicle Services offices and at county courthouses, among other places. But there&#039;s no time to procrastinate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, a number of grassroots supporters helped &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/stateupdates/gGCpc9&quot;&gt;canvass Oregon neighborhoods&lt;/a&gt; to register new voters, and there is still time to &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/contact/splash/callor&quot;&gt;help out by calling Oregon&lt;/a&gt; residents and encouraging them to register before tomorrow&#039;s deadline.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you live in Oregon, here&#039;s what you need to know about tomorrow&#039;s deadline and the upcoming primary:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All elections in Oregon are Vote by Mail.  Ballots must be received by May 20th.  To vote for Barack you must be:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Registered as a Democrat by April 29th&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At least 18 years old on or before May 20, 2008&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A resident of Oregon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;You should re-register if&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Your residence address or mailing address has changed, because a ballot will be sent to the address where you are registered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) You are not registered as a Democrat and need to change your political party affiliation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) You have not voted for five years or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For more information, visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sos.state.or.us/elections/votreg/vreg.htm&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Oregon Secretary of State&#039;s website&lt;/a&gt; or stop by the Oregon for Obama &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/oroffices&quot;&gt;field office closest to you&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/oregonvoterreg/&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.barackobama.com/images/or/regfeature_banner.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>On the Ground: Canvassing in Oregon</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;While most of the attention of late has been on Indiana and North Carolina, grassroots supporters are hard at work throughout the remaining states as well. Earlier today, &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/dashboard/public/gGWmt3&quot;&gt;Ryan&lt;/a&gt; from Salem, Oregon &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/OregonMatters/gGCpcn&quot;&gt;wrote about his experience helping register voters&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I canvassed for Barack Obama. Michelle, Josh and I went door to door registering people to vote. The Oregon primary registration is two days away (Apr 29). We successfully registered or changed registrations for six people. One we switched from Republican to Democrat to vote for Barack and another we changed from Independent/Unaffiliated to Democrat to vote for Barack. In another case we recruited a volunteer to badger some young movers to register Democrat. We got their registrations also. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am invigorated reconnecting others to vote and making a difference. By canvassing, I take ownership of Barack&#039;s campaign. I am a part of the movement for change. I am no longer sitting on my couch waiting for events to unfold. I am making it happen and together we can effect change. Yes we can!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deadline to register to vote in Oregon is this Tuesday. If you live in Oregon, there is still time to &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/oregonvoterreg/&quot;&gt;download your registration form&lt;/a&gt;. And if like Ryan, you too are tired of sitting on the sidelines, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/orpcc_home/&quot;&gt;sign up to become a Community Organizer&lt;/a&gt; and help lead our grassroots efforts in Oregon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countless supporters have given their time and labor to canvass communities across America over the past few months, and many of you have shared your experiences in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/members&quot;&gt;Community Blogs&lt;/a&gt;. If you&#039;ve written about your experience (or would like to now), post a link to your blog in the comments below. We&#039;ll highlight some of the best stories throughout the coming week here on the HQ blog, as we count down to the May 6th primaries in Indiana and North Carolina.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Blumenauer Responds</title>
            <description>U.S. Congressman and superdelegate Earl Blumenauer stopped by our Oregon headquarters this morning to deliver a rousing speech to the hundred volunteers who&#039;d gathered for a voter registration canvass. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blumenauer was flanked by a Bend &lt;em&gt;Bulletin&lt;/em&gt; article from last week which profiled the Oregon-specific positions of Sens. Obama and Clinton on the environment and rural communities. However Blumenauer emphasized that what Oregonians need is not another 13-page document, but the ability to bring people together to produce the kind of change Americans need -- such as bringing the war to a close and providing much-needed education and health-care reforms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Senator Obama is the only candidate in this race who doesn&#039;t take money from special interest PACs,&amp;quot; Blumenauer also stressed, explaining how a president beholden to lobbyists will never be able to change corrupt Washington ways. &amp;quot;The issue is who is going to finally kick the special interests out of Washington D.C. to get it done.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/S24PAP4Y&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/S24PAP4Y&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; wmode=&quot;transparent&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;With the Oregon registration deadline quickly approaching -- this Tuesday the 29th is the last day to register or switch parties to become a Democrat -- Blumenauer urged the assembled activists and volunteers to reach out to as many potential voters as possible in advance of the May 20th primary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week, Blumenauer was joined by fellow Oregon Congressman David Wu as superdelegates pledging their support for Sen. Obama at the Democratic convention.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;In other news&lt;/strong&gt;, the Oregon AFSCME group is hard at work here for Sen. Obama.  Having broken from the national union to endorse Obama, executive director Ken Allen and his fellow AFSCME members have been working overtime to get-out-the-vote among their 20,000-plus team statewide.  The endorsement -- and hard work of the local AFSCME folks -- reiterates how strong Sen. Obama is on the issues that matter most to organized labor.  &amp;quot;Our members are proud that Oregon AFSCME speaks with an independent voice, and are working hard everyday to change Washington by electing Barack Obama president,&amp;quot; remarked Allen recently.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c158/AnthonySF/AFSCMEobama2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;</description>

            <title>Oregon Women, Veterans Show Support for Obama</title>
            <description>Over 250 Oregon women gathered at the Benson Hotel in downtown Portland yesterday to declare their support for Barack Obama.  Our statewide women&#039;s steering committee was announced at the event, and a panel of prominent speakers discussed why Sen. Obama was their choice for the Democratic nomination.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img width=450; src=&quot;http://s27.photobucket.com/albums/c158/AnthonySF/WomenF.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Former Portland Mayor Vera Katz spoke about the inspiration she felt after first hearing Bobby Kennedy speak during his 1968 presidential run, and how Barack Obama is the only candidate since then to similarly inspire her.  Former Governor Barbara Roberts then took to the podium to discuss how Sen. Obama is the best on a wide variety of issues -- the environment, health care, getting out of Iraq -- that matter to Oregonians.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Meanwhile in Salem yesterday, a group of veterans supporting Sen. Obama held an event at the local VFW to discuss why he is the best candidate on veterans&#039; and national security matters.  Iraq War veteran Dmitry White spoke in detail about the consequences of our actions in Iraq, and how Sen. Obama&#039;s judgment and early opposition to the war make him the logical choice to lead our nation.  Other speakers included retired Vietnam Green Beret Jim Rassmann, heavily involved with veterans&#039; affairs issues, and Benjamin Hier, a vet from the war in Afghanistan who leads the local Veterans for Obama chapter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Congressman David Wu Endorses Barack Obama for President</title>
            <description>PORTLAND, OR&lt;em&gt; &amp;mdash; &lt;/em&gt;Today U.S. Congressman David Wu from Oregon announced his support for Senator Barack Obama for president, citing his ability to make real change:    &lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 12pt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;I think we are blessed to have two strong candidates for president,&amp;quot; Congressman David Wu said. &amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;I am endorsing Barack Obama for president today because I believe that he is best suited to turn the page on this sorry episode in American history. &amp;nbsp;He and I both had the judgment to oppose the Iraq War from the very beginning. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;quot;Every dollar that we have spent in Iraq&amp;mdash;which adds up to over $500 billion so far&amp;mdash;is a dollar not spent at home, a school not built, a bridge not repaired,&amp;quot; continued Wu. &amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;We need new policies both at home and abroad. &amp;nbsp;Like Americans, the international community wants to see real change in America and I believe that Senator Obama embodies that change.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 12pt&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;I thank Congressman Wu for his support, and look forward to working with him to bring this war in Iraq to an end, strengthening our economy and addressing the issue of climate change,&amp;rdquo; said Senator Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Congressman Wu is in his fifth term representing Oregon&amp;rsquo;s First Congressional District.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Wu is Senator Obama&amp;rsquo;s 240th &amp;nbsp;Superdelegate endorsement. Senator Obama is now 291 delegates away from winning the Democratic Party&amp;rsquo;s presidential nomination. &lt;/p&gt;  </description>

            <title>Oregon &#039;Register-Guard&#039; Endorses Obama</title>
            <description>Residents of Eugene awoke yesterday morning to the good news that the &lt;em&gt;Register-Guard&lt;/em&gt; has decided &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/dt.cms.support.viewStory.cls?cid=95279&amp;amp;sid=5&amp;amp;fid=1&quot;&gt;to endorse Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in the Democratic primary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The dispiriting tone of the campaign echoes that of the past several election cycles, in which the voters&#039; divisions over small matters have been exploited for transitory gain, obscuring the need for clarity of purpose in confronting the many large challenges that face the nation... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voters should grasp the opportunity to open a new chapter -- a chapter with a fresh political vocabulary, elevated discourse and rekindled hopes. Obama offers that opportunity, and Oregon Democrats should support him in the May 20 primary election...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Democrats had a presidential nominee in 2004 who was both for and against the war, and it did not end well. Obama is free of all that baggage, which liberates him to credibly promise to move the nation beyond the past 20 years of Bush and Clinton presidencies. His domestic policy proposals differ in many details from Clinton&#039;s, but the biggest difference is that they would be received as representing not a reaction to the Bush administration or a continuation of the one before, but a real break with the past...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oregon has a rare moment of relevance in the nominating process. Oregon Democrats should use it to give Barack Obama the chance to become the first Democratic president of the 21st century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Register-Guard&lt;/em&gt; now joins &lt;em&gt;The Oregonian&lt;/em&gt; and several other Oregon publications in endorsing Sen. Obama in advance of next month&#039;s vote. Read the rest on our new &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/orpress&quot;&gt;Oregon Press Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

            <title>Election Excitement Spurs Voter Registration</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gazettetimes.com/articles/2008/04/21/news/opinion/7edi01_edit0421.txt&quot;&gt;Corvallis Gazette Times&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/blog/logo_CorvallisGazetteTimes.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;Oregon is enjoying a rare moment in the national political spotlight this spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Democratic presidential nomination still up for grabs, candidates Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have both made pilgrimages to the Beaver State, hoping to woo voters here in the weeks before Oregon&amp;rsquo;s primary election.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obama even stopped last month in Corvallis, where he spent an hour or so shaking hands and talking with locals at American Dream Pizza downtown. After campaign stops in Portland and Salem, Obama was headed for a late-night rally in Eugene when he and his entourage pulled into Corvallis. When he left, Obama took with him a to-go order of pizzas to feed the hungry campaign staff traveling on his bus.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;This is heady stuff for a place that most election years is more or less ignored by presidential candidates during primary season. (It&amp;rsquo;s not that they aren&amp;rsquo;t happy to have our votes. It&amp;rsquo;s that Oregon&amp;rsquo;s primary is held so late in the process that both parties have usually decided their nominees long before we get around to casting our ballots.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah, but this year is different. Oregon&amp;rsquo;s May 20 primary matters dearly to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton because they&amp;rsquo;re still locked in an incredibly close race for the Democratic nomination. The candidates are excited about Oregon because, as tight as this race is, they know our votes might actually swing it one way or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that Oregon residents &amp;mdash; especially Oregon Democrats &amp;mdash; are also pretty pumped about this race. Although the primary is nearly a month away, voter registration in Oregon has set an all-time record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;All of the excitement that people are seeing on television, when they go to the rallies, and when they talk about the campaigns with their friends &amp;hellip; I think that is going to translate into increased voter registration, increased activity on the part of voter,&amp;rdquo; said Scott Moore, who is with the secretary of state&amp;rsquo;s office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly 2 million Oregonians have registered to vote in the May 20 primary. Statewide, Democrats are seeing the biggest boost in registration numbers &amp;mdash; no doubt in large part because of the interest stirred by the race for that party&amp;rsquo;s presidential nomination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same holds true in Benton County. Since Jan. 1, the total number of registered voters here has increased by more than 2,000 &amp;mdash; from 44,878 at the beginning of the year to 46,949 as of April 18. Again, it is the Democrats seeing the big bounce, with their numbers up from 18,259 registered voters on Jan. 1 to 20,470 on April 18.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be that it&amp;rsquo;s the Obama-Clinton race that has brought all this political excitement and attention to Oregon. But the boost in voter registration numbers means that more people will be casting ballots in local and state races, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We think that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing. Check out all the candidates. Catch the excitement. But don&amp;rsquo;t wait too long. The last day to register to vote in the Oregon primary is April 29.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

            <title>&quot;Green&quot; Grassroots Support and More</title>
            <description>The Obama campaign here in Oregon is up and running at full speed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Earlier today, senior campaign environmental policy advisor Dan Kammen held town hall meetings in both Eugene and Portland to discuss Sen. Obama&#039;s plans for fighting global warming.  He touched upon the need to wean ourselves off foreign oil, to create &quot;green collar&quot; jobs, and to protect our natural resources here in Oregon and across the country.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But that&#039;s not all.  To commemorate the 21st debate of the primary season, a large group of supporters gathered at locations across Oregon last night to cheer on Sen. Obama.  (At Kell&#039;s in downtown Portland there was an especially spirited group.)  The topics of the debate ranged from Iraq to middle-class tax relief to Social Security solvency, and Sen. Obama laid out his clear plans for change he&#039;s going to bring to Washington.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img width=450; src=&quot;http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c158/AnthonySF/Debate019.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And to cap off a busy week, this week we announced the launch of our OCO program; hundreds of supporters across the state have now enlisted in this innovative new grassroots outreach effort.  Our Obama OCOs -- or Oregon Community Organizers -- will take leadership of their communities by registering voters, organizing supporters, and contacting as many potential Obama voters as possible.  Interested?  Don&#039;t hesitate to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/orpcc_home&quot;&gt;join one of our teams today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Want to get involved with the campaign further?  Stop by one of our &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/oroffices&quot;&gt;eight Oregon campaign offices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; whenever you get a chance.</description>

            <title>Local Supporters Become Community Organizers</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ktvl.com/news/obama_1186136___article.html/volunteers_campaign.html&quot;&gt; KTVL TV:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/blog/logo_KTVL.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;89&quot; height=&quot;85&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;Senator Barack Obama&#039;s presidential campaign is stepping up efforts in Oregon and he&#039;s relying on local volunteers. Volunteers are learning to rally support for Obama through phone calls and by going door to door. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Supporters at the newly opened Obama office in Medford say Oregon is the first state to be given control over its community level campaign. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Medford office is holding training sessions every Tuesday and Thursday to teach volunteers what to do. Those volunteers will in turn train others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;quot;We&#039;re going to teach people how to canvas. We&#039;re going to teach people how to phone bank. We&#039;re going to teach them how to organize and we&#039;re going to teach them how to run the campaign so that we in our own neighborhoods are going to take charge and see senator Obama all the way to D.C.,&amp;quot; says volunteer Denise Cyr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supporters are encouraged to sign up on line or stop by the Medford Obama office. That office is in back of the Jackson County Democrats headquarters on Central Avenue. Volunteers are generally there from 9 to 6 Monday through Friday. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Obama office had its grand opening last Sunday. With an office in Bend opening Wednesday night there are eight offices for Obama in Oregon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;		 &lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/OCO&quot;&gt;sign up now&lt;/a&gt; to lead our grassroots efforts in your neighborhood as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/orpcc_home/&quot;&gt;Oregon Community Organizer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>&#039;State treasurer says Obama will bring tax relief to Oregonians&#039;</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;This editorial, written by &lt;strong&gt;Randall Edwards, Oregon State Treasurer&lt;/strong&gt;, comes to us compliments of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://159.54.226.83/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080416/OPINION/804160433/1049&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Statesman Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/blog/logo_statesmanjournal.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve served the people of Oregon for more than 10 years. During my time as a state legislator and State Treasurer, I&#039;ve seen hard working families in Oregon face financial difficulties time and time again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As we paid our taxes this week, I know Oregon families are feeling pinched in these difficult economic times and they need tax relief. I believe that Senator Obama is the one candidate who has the vision and the ability to change Washington, finally delivering tax relief to hard working Oregonians and all Americans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Senator Obama&#039;s bold and innovative plan to cut taxes for working Americans will help those who need it most: middle-class families and seniors. His plan will cut taxes for over 150 million workers and their families across the country, and it will simplify tax filings so millions of Americans can do their taxes in less than 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From the start of this campaign, Senator Obama has recognized the concerns of everyday Americans. He knows that billions of dollars have been diverted from helping hard working Americans right here at home. That&#039;s why he has proposed middle-class tax cuts that will give 95% of working Americans a break.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Senator Obama&#039;s tax fairness plan would allow many Oregon families to take advantage of a new &amp;quot;Making Work Pay&amp;quot; tax credit of up to $1,000 for working families. And Senator Obama recognizes the difficulty many American families are facing due to the uncertain state of the housing market, including thousands of families right here in Oregon. Senator Obama will ensure that anyone with a mortgage, not just the well-off, can take advantage of tax incentives for homeownership by establishing a universal mortgage credit. His plan would create a 10 percent credit that will benefit an additional 10 million homeowners. Many of these homeowners earn less than $50,000 per year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And Senator Obama wants to restore honor for America&#039;s senior citizens, many of whom struggle everyday to make ends meet. He has proposed eliminating all income taxes for seniors making less than $50,000 per year. Nearly seven million seniors would not have to pay any income tax under Senator Obama&#039;s plan, at a savings of roughly $1,400 each year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It won&#039;t be easy to change the failed policies that have left millions of American families in financial difficulty. I&#039;m supporting Senator Obama because I believe he has the ability to bring real change to Washington DC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I know Senator Obama will stand up to special interests. His campaign doesn&#039;t accept money from the Political Action Committees or Washington lobbyists that have kept us from coming together and making progress on these issues. And they won&#039;t influence policy in the White House. Senator Obama has proposed to pay for his tax reform plan by closing corporate loopholes, cracking down on international tax havens, and increasing the dividends and capital gains rate for the richest Americans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I know Oregonians - indeed all Americans - are tired of the politics that have left this great country divided. Senator Obama has worked with Democrats and Republicans on wide range of issues - form ethics reform to expanding access to health care to lowering taxes for America&#039;s working families. As President, I know Senator Obama will be able to bring real change to Washington DC, because he believes that when we are united, we can overcome the tough challenges we face today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

            <title>&#039;The Boss&#039; Makes His Decision</title>
            <description>In a surprise announcement on his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brucespringsteen.net/news/index.html&quot;&gt;personal website&lt;/a&gt; this morning, Bruce Springsteen revealed his choice for the presidency:  Sen. Barack Obama.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The voice behind such iconic American anthems as &quot;Badlands,&quot; &quot;Thunder Road,&quot; &quot;The River,&quot; and &quot;The Promised Land&quot; has decided to throw his weight behind the one candidate in the race who can bring about the kind of change that this country desperately needs.  His statement read, in part:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;He has the depth, the reflectiveness, and the resilience to be our next President. He speaks to the America I&#039;ve envisioned in my music for the past 35 years, a generous nation with a citizenry willing to tackle nuanced and complex problems, a country that&#039;s interested in its collective destiny and in the potential of its gathered spirit...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the moment, critics have tried to diminish Senator Obama through the exaggeration of certain of his comments and relationships. While these matters are worthy of some discussion, they have been ripped out of the context and fabric of the man&#039;s life and vision, so well described in his excellent book, Dreams of My Father, often in order to distract us from discussing the real issues: war and peace, the fight for economic and racial justice, reaffirming our Constitution, and the protection and enhancement of our environment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After the terrible damage done over the past eight years, a great American reclamation project needs to be undertaken. I believe that Senator Obama is the best candidate to lead that project and to lead us into the 21st Century with a renewed sense of moral purpose and of ourselves as Americans.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Over here on E Street, we&#039;re proud to support Obama for President.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Bruce Springsteen recently made a swing through Portland on the current leg of his tour, playing to a sold-out crowd at the Rose Garden.</description>

            <title>Host a Voter Registration House Party</title>
            <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://or.barackobama.com/ORhouseparties&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.barackobama.com/images/email/mvoregonmp_email.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; From the beginning, we knew that grassroots support would be the foundation of this campaign. For more than a year, our supporters have answered the call &amp;mdash; organizing neighborhoods, talking to voters, and building our movement one person and one voice at a time.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But with Oregon&#039;s voter registration deadline coming up on April 29th, it&#039;s never been more important to take ownership of this effort.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That&#039;s why we&#039;re asking you to be a leader for Barack in Oregon by hosting a More Voices House Party on Saturday, April 26th. These parties are a great way to introduce Barack&#039;s message to your friends and neighbors &amp;mdash; and bring more people and more voices into the primary process.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No prior political experience is required.&lt;/strong&gt; A typical party will have 10 to 12 guests, and we&#039;ll provide you with everything you need for a successful party, including a host DVD, Obama gear, and even a local speaker. All you need is a willingness to turn your enthusiasm for Barack into action.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://or.barackobama.com/ORhouseparties&quot;&gt;Sign up now&lt;/a&gt; to help grow this movement in Oregon &amp;mdash; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://or.barackobama.com/ORhouseparties&quot;&gt;host a More Voices House Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;These parties should be a lot of fun &amp;mdash; I hope you can join us and host.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aubrey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Aubrey Cunningham&lt;br /&gt; More Voices House Parties Coordinator&lt;br /&gt; Obama for America&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Rep. Abercrombie Rallies for Obama in Eugene</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://media.www.dailyemerald.com/media/storage/paper859/news/2008/04/14/News/Clinton.Obama.Campaigners.Speak.At.Eugene.Hilton-3322231.shtml&quot;&gt;Oregon Daily Emerald&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/blog/logo_OregonDailyEmerald.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;188&quot; height=&quot;47&quot; /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congressman Neil Abercrombie, D-HI, brought the Democratic nomination fight back to Eugene Friday and Saturday with appearances at the Oregon Democratic Party&#039;s Platform Convention at the Eugene Hilton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abercrombie, an Obama supporter, maintained a high level of energy throughout his Friday night convention speech. He shouted and drew sharp contrasts with John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee. Abercrombie said McCain is too heavily influenced by neoconservatives who are &amp;quot;modern imperialists.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;What George Bush did (militarily), McCain thinks we should do even more,&amp;quot; Abercrombie told the Emerald.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip; Abercrombie said Sen. Clinton&#039;s candidacy is as historic as Obama&#039;s, but that Obama has a better chance of bringing independent and independent-minded Republican voters to Democrats in the general election.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;Keating, a 31-year-old theater arts major, said he recently started a students for Obama club because of the &amp;quot;immense, contagious, super energy around Obama.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip; Abercrombie, who knew the Illinois senator&#039;s parents, talked about his memories of &amp;quot;little Barry&amp;quot; as a child and the first time he heard Obama speak at Obama&#039;s sister&#039;s wedding in Hawaii.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;In Hawaii, our diversity defines us rather than divides us, that is the message of aloha,&amp;quot; Abercrombie said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obama brings a similar attitude to politics, he said. &amp;quot;I can&#039;t find someone outside of the United States who doesn&#039;t want Barack Obama to be president.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

            <title>Two More Oregon Offices, and a Special Visit</title>
            <description>&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Way back in the &amp;lsquo;70s, a young couple raising a little boy who would grow up to be the leading Democratic contender for President of the United States befriended a fellow University of Hawaii student named Neil Abercrombie.&amp;nbsp; Abercrombie, now a nine-term congressman from Hawaii&amp;rsquo;s first district, returned to the mainland last night to represent the couple&amp;rsquo;s son, Sen. Barack Obama, at the Oregon Democratic Party&amp;rsquo;s convention in Eugene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Flanked by a strong visibility presence outside the local Hilton, Rep. Abercrombie &amp;ndash; a superdelegate and early backer of Obama&amp;rsquo;s candidacy &amp;ndash; discussed with the crowd how the 2008 election is about the future, not the past, and that Barack is the only candidate who can truly &amp;quot;stand up to the special interests&amp;quot; that have permeated Washington.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The congressman is also a prominent member of the House Progressive Caucus, and has been a staunch opponent of the war in Iraq since the beginning.&amp;nbsp; Abercrombie cited Sen. Obama&#039;s opposition as another reason why he&#039;s the country&#039;s best choice in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to his appearance at the convention in Eugene, Rep. Abercrombie will be heading up to Salem this morning to cut the ribbon on the Obama campaign&#039;s sixth Oregon office.&amp;nbsp; Then on Sunday, we&#039;ll be opening yet another new office in Medford.&amp;nbsp; And yes, there&#039;ll be more office openings in the near future, building on the overwhelming grassroots support of Oregonians for Sen. Obama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c158/AnthonySF/AbercrombiePics010.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</description>

And in 1992 he led a voter registration drive that registered 150,000 new voters in Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What we need to do over the next few weeks is just what Barack did as a young man -- reach out to friends and neighbors and start bringing about the kind of change we need.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You don&#039;t need any prior experience to take part. As an Oregon Community Organizer, you&#039;ll have the training and tools you&#039;ll need to be successful and build our movement in your community.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://or.barackobama.com/OCO&quot;&gt;Sign up to be a leader for Barack in Oregon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Everything we&#039;ve achieved together in this campaign is thanks to ordinary people committing to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I hope you&#039;ll help keep this momentum going in Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rob&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rob Hill&lt;br /&gt; Oregon State Director&lt;br /&gt; Obama for America&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Two Former Oregon Governors Endorse Obama</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;The AP &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oregonlive.com/newsflash/regional/index.ssf?/base/elections-0/1207839848150850.xml&amp;amp;storylist=orlocal&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;...&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) &amp;mdash; Two former Oregon governors say they will support Barack Obama for president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barbara Roberts and John Kitzhaber gave their endorsements to the Illinois senator on Thursday, just before the Democratic Party of Oregon holds its platform convention this weekend...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts praised Obama for his opposition to the war in Iraq and his support for sustainable environmental policies. Kitzhaber said Obama is the best candidate to bring some real change to American politics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To partipate in the Oregon Democratic Primary on May 20th, you must be a registered Democrat by April 29th. If you&#039;re from Oregon,&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/content/orvoterreg&quot;&gt;register to vote or change your party.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For folks in other states who want to help us win in Oregon, &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/call&quot;&gt;make some calls today&lt;/a&gt;. It&#039;s one of the most powerful and direct ways that you can make a personal imprint on this historic campaign. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>More Offices, More Support in Oregon</title>
            <description>After cutting the ribbon on our state headquarters in Portland and a satellite office in Eugene a week ago, the Obama campaign announced the opening of additional Oregon field offices in Corvallis, Beaverton, and Oregon City. Obama remains the only presidential contender to open offices in the state &amp;mdash; now with &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/oroffices&quot;&gt;a total of five&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To celebrate the opening of the Beaverton office, a group of high schoolers supporting Obama had a phonebanking party on Friday night to chat with voters and discuss their favorite candidate. After 1500 phone calls and a round of pizzas, the first-time voters decided to make the Friday night gathering a weekly event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Saturday, a group of about 70 volunteers gathered to celebrate the new Beaverton digs and canvass to spread Sen. Obama&#039;s message of change. AFSCME Executive Director Ken Allen fired up the crowd by describing his level of commitment (he plans to take a one-week vacation and help the campaign contact voters every day), after which organizer Alison Zelman led supporters in a mini-training before hitting the doors. As was the case in Portland last Saturday, a potluck awaited the returning canvassers after a long day of important work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c158/AnthonySF/BeaverB.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.oregonlive.com/mapesonpolitics/2008/04/parsing_oregon_democratic_regi.html&quot;&gt;seems to be the case&lt;/a&gt; in the leadup to Oregon&#039;s April 29th deadline, several people were re-registering as Democrats in order to vote in the primary for Obama. One woman in particular &amp;mdash; a former Republican named Kathy &amp;mdash; thought Barack&#039;s message of hope and unity was inspiring enough to change parties. She is joining a growing group of Obama Republicans, or as they liked to be called, &amp;quot;Obamacans.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obama supporters in Corvallis and Oregon City were also excited to kickoff local campaign efforts. And five Obama offices in Oregon isn&#039;t the end, either &amp;mdash; stay tuned for more locations in the coming days.&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c158/AnthonySF/BeaverA.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

At three of these events -- in Beaverton, Corvallis, and Oregon City -- we&#039;ll also celebrate the openings of new campaign offices before hitting the streets.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Find a canvass location near you and sign up to join fellow supporters registering Democrats this weekend:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://or.barackobama.com/ORcanvass&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;http://or.barackobama.com/ORcanvass&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of Oregonians are not registered as Democrats -- but are eager to support Barack in the primary. We need your help to reach as many people as possible before the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Personal contact from someone like you is the most effective way to encourage these potential supporters to register as Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Come out to a canvass this weekend -- you&#039;ll meet our campaign staff and fellow supporters, hear more about our grassroots strategy for organizing in Oregon, and then start making a difference right away.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Find the event near you and sign up now:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://or.barackobama.com/ORcanvass&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;http://or.barackobama.com/ORcanvass&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Thanks for all that you do,&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rob&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rob Hill&lt;br /&gt; Oregon State Director&lt;br /&gt; Obama for America&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Oregon Union Leaders Decry Clinton Vote for Big Oil Tax Breaks</title>
            <description>With gas prices nearing an all time high -- AAA currently ranks Oregon&#039;s average of $3.406 per regular unleaded gallon as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fuelgaugereport.com/sbsavg.asp&quot;&gt;7th-highest in the nation&lt;/a&gt; -- three local union leaders backing Sen. Obama spoke before a crowd of concerned Oregonians this afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oregon AFSCME Executive Director Ken Allen, ILWU Oregon-Area Vice President Ryan Takas, and Teamster Lynn Leribach each took turns addressing the group of nearly 50 about the rising cost of fuel and how Sen. Clinton&#039;s 2004&#039;s vote to give Big Oil $10 million dollars in tax breaks is hurting Oregon families. Takas in particular noted the strain that the high cost of gas is placing on average Oregonians like himself -- in some instances, forcing people to decide between filling up their tanks and putting food on the table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c158/AnthonySF/GasB.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;More important, said Allen, was the fact that oil companies are lining their pockets with the help of Congress. Sen. Clinton joined a large number of Republicans in voting in favor of giving the executives of Shell, Exxon, and their ilk millions of dollars in tax relief. Standing under a sign at a NW Portland Chevron station advertising a gallon for $3.59 -- nearing an all-time record -- Allen remarked that &amp;quot;we need a leader like Obama to change how Washington works so that it works for ordinary people.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c158/AnthonySF/GasA.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;Before, during, and after the speeches, dozens of Obama supporters lined W. Burnside to the cheers and honks of fellow fed-up Oregonians.</description>

            <title>Key Oregon Dems Throw Support Behind Obama</title>
            <description>Demonstrating how much support Sen. Obama has here in Oregon, on the capitol steps in Salem this morning a large group of state legislators and other Oregon elected officials enthusiastically announced their endorsement of Barack in the presidential primary.  In all, nearly half of the Democrats in the state legislature are supporting Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination, including 5 senators and 19 representatives.  State Treasurer Randall Edwards and State Superintendent of Public Instruction Susan Castillo were also on hand to declare their backing.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c158/AnthonySF/Leg2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representative Mary Nolan took the microphone and explained how there&#039;s only one candidate in the Democratic race that can bring the kind of change that Oregon and the country need right now after the failed policies of the Bush years.  Treasurer Edwards also spoke, citing Sen. Obama&#039;s vision to end the war in Iraq, fight global warming, and provide healthcare to all Americans as the reasons for his endorsement.  Speaker of the House Jeff Merkley agreed, referring to Barack&#039;s &amp;quot;detailed agenda&amp;quot; as the reason behind his support.  Senator Ben Westlund noted Obama&#039;s electability as the key factor in his decision, remarking that having &amp;quot;a strong candidate at the top of the ticket is critically important&amp;quot; for Democrats in Oregon and around the nation.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c158/AnthonySF/Leg4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the press conference, State Sen. Avel Gordly - a registered Independent - filled out a voter registration card to formally change her party affiliation to Democrat so that she could vote for Barack Obama in Oregon&#039;s closed primary next month.  She then headed across the street to the secretary of state&#039;s office to drop it off.  State law says that you must be a registered member of a party to vote in its nominating contest, and April 29th is the last day Oregonians can register or change their party status to Democratic in order to vote for Obama.  Gordly encouraged all registered Independents, Republicans, and members of other parties do the same if they desire the kind of change being sought by Barack Obama, who she called &amp;quot;a unifier.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c158/AnthonySF/Leg3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;262&quot; height=&quot;367&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;Obama&#039;s legislative supporters include Senate President Pro Tempore Margaret Carter (Portland), Sen. Alan Bates (Ashland), Sen. Avel Gordly (Portland), Sen. Floyd Prozanski (South Lane and North Douglas Counties), Sen. Ben Westlund (Tumalo), Speaker of the House Jeff Merkley (Portland), Speaker Pro Tempore Diane Rosenbaum (Portland), Rep. Jeff  Barker (Aloha), Rep. Phil Barnhart (Central Lane and Linn Counties), Rep. Suzanne Bonamici (Washington County), Rep. Peter Buckley (Ashland), Rep. Ben Cannon (Portland), Rep. Brian Clem (Salem), Rep. Chris Edwards (West Eugene), Rep. Dave Edwards (Hillsboro), Rep. Larry Galizio (Tigard), Rep. Paul Holvey (Eugene), Rep. Betty Komp (Woodburn), Rep. Tina Kotek (North Portland), Rep. Mary Nolan (Portland), Rep. Tobias Read (Beaverton), Rep. Mike Schaufler (Happy Valley, Rep. Chip Shields (Portland), and Rep. Brad Witt (Clatskanie).  Earlier this spring, Obama secured the endorsement of Portland-area Congressman and superdelegate Earl Blumenauer, who spoke on the Senator&#039;s behalf at our Portland headquarters office opening last weekend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>All in a Day&#039;s Work: Oregon HQ Opening and Huge Statewide Canvass</title>
            <description>A light touch of Portland spring rain couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep the crowd away, as more than 500 supporters showed up to the official opening of our Oregon state headquarters on the southeast side of town this morning. Located where the old Wild Oats grocery store used to be, activists young and old, black and white, veteran and newcomer, Democratic and otherwise came to be part of the movement that&amp;rsquo;s going to change Oregon and the rest of this country. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/blog/ORopening.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multnomah County Regional Field Director Jim Nam spoke about the importance of Oregon in the Democratic primary battle, and then lead Field Organizer Kristin Gwinn got into the gritty details of the volunteer army we are building that will lead the campaign to victory on May 20th. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two special guests also addressed the crowd. Portland Congressman Earl Blumenauer &amp;ndash; an Obama superdelegate and co-chair of the campaign here in Oregon &amp;ndash; discussed why we need a leader like Barack Obama in the White House to bring about the change that&amp;rsquo;s eluded us after 8 years of President Bush. Rep. Blumenauer endorsed Sen. Obama back in February and has been one of his most outspoken advocates throughout Oregon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accompanying Rep. Blumenauer was Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky of Chicago, who&amp;rsquo;s served alongside Sen. Obama for many years in both the Illinois legislature and then in Washington. She spoke to the fired-up crowd about the importance of grassroots organizing and why volunteers are the most important part of a winning political campaign. She also headed out with the canvassing teams later in the day so she could make the case for Sen. Obama face-to-face with the voters of Oregon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the speakers were done, the mass of newly recruited volunteers broke out into groups based on which part of Portland they wanted to canvass. The field staff then trained them with canvassing instructions and voter registration cards before sending them out pounding pavement and knocking on doors for change. Canvass for Change events will likely happen every weekend, as April 29th is the last day to register as a Democrat in Oregon, which you must do to vote in the primary. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A potluck followed the day&amp;rsquo;s canvass, as hundreds of hungry volunteers returned to HQ to feast on some homemade grub. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile a couple hours south in Eugene, State Representative Phil Barnhart addressed an equally excited crowd about the new Obama campaign office in Lane County and the importance of devoting time to a cause you can believe in. He described how Sen. Obama is the right agent of change at the right time in our country&amp;rsquo;s history, but that it&amp;rsquo;s the volunteers and grassroots supporters who will make the difference. A large group of canvassers then headed out across town to spread Barack&amp;rsquo;s message of uniting this country. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the office openings in Portland and Eugene, more than 1,000 Oregonians Canvassed for Change. Teams of supporters also knocked on doors today in Corvallis, Tigard, Hillsboro, Oregon City, Forest Grove, Beaverton, Salem, Newberg, Keizer, Medford, Bend, Ashland, Grants Pass, Roseburg, Prineville, Terrebonne, Gresham, and Troutdale. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Eugene field office is located at 1280 Willammette St, while the Oregon state HQ is at 3016 SE Division St in Portland. Additional field offices throughout the state will be cutting their ribbons in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/amqos8jm&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;transparent&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.slideflickr.com/slide/amqos8jm&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>&#039;On the Bus with Barack&#039;</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blueoregon.com/2008/03/on-the-bus-with.html&quot;&gt;BlueOregon&lt;/a&gt;, guest-blogger Congressman Earl Blumenauer provided an in-depth, behind the scenes look at Barack&#039;s recent campaign swing through Orgeon. Congresssman Blumenauer talks about life on the road, the huge crowds and private meetings, and the energy, enthusiasm and transformative power of this extraordinary campaign. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/blog/logo_BlueOregon.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;209&quot; height=&quot;57&quot; /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday March 21st, Barack Obama took Oregon by storm and I had a front row seat. Actually my front row seat started 46 hours earlier as the word of his pending visit spread. As the co-chair of the Oregon campaign and leading the efforts in the state, we were swamped by the reaction. Even with the arrival of paid Obama staff, the wave we sensed became a tsunami of Obama fever. By Friday morning, it was clear that something special was going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People had arrived early including some camping overnight. One prominent Republican told me, with a smile, that he was there &amp;quot;under an assumed name.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The energy, the enthusiasm, the insight and the hope in evidence in that room would characterize the entire day.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Watching Obama&#039;s arrival, his easy manner working his way through the line and locking on small groups, giving warm and full attention to each person was phenomenal. I wondered what it would be like as the grueling day wore on with 30,000 more people . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blueoregon.com/2008/03/on-the-bus-with.html&quot;&gt;Read the full article by Congressman Earl Blumenauer . . .&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://or.barackobama.com&quot;&gt;OR.BarackObama.com&lt;/a&gt; for more news and info from Oregon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>&#039;Welcome to the start of the Oregon primary&#039;</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/dt.cms.support.viewStory.cls?cid=81919&amp;amp;sid=4&amp;amp;fid=1&quot;&gt; &lt;em&gt;Register-Guard:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/blog/logo_RegisterGuard.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;207&quot; height=&quot;29&quot; /&gt;	 	 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Obama ended his 14-hour tour through Oregon at 10 p.m., when he concluded his 45-minute speech at Eugene&#039;s McArthur Court at the University of Oregon. As has been the case throughout his youth-energizing campaign, the 9,000-strong crowd was full of college and university students who responded wildly to Obama&#039;s messages of unity and change. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; That included Obama&#039;s reference to the gamble he made when he launched his campaign, that his message would catch on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;quot;I am here to report that my bet has paid off, that my faith has been vindicated,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Americans are standing up and they&#039;re saying, &#039;We want something new. We want something different. We want to turn the page. We want to write a new chapter in American history.&#039;&amp;thinsp;&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ... Obama started the day with a similarly raucous arena event at Portland&#039;s Memorial Coliseum, where former Democratic presidential rival, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, endorsed him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ... After dazzling the Portland crowd of 13,000 with his 50-minute speech, Obama traveled to Salem for a midafternoon town hall. There, he went off script during a question-and-answer exchange with some of the 3,000-person audience at the National Guard Armory. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ... Obama&#039;s motorcade made an unscheduled stop at 5:30 p.m. for dinner at a downtown Corvallis pizza parlor, where Obama did some retail politicking with the unsuspecting locals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; He capped the day with his Eugene appearance. Although the Illinois senator had already been in Oregon for hours during this visit, his second of the campaign, the Eugene audience was happy to consider his stop at Mac Court as the official start of the race in Oregon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;quot;Welcome to the official start of the Oregon primary,&amp;quot; Obama&#039;s chairman, U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, told a thundering crowd that was awaiting the presidential contender himself. &amp;quot;It starts in The Pit.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

            <title>Obama holds town hall meeting in Medford, OR</title>
            <description>&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3177/2353015264_5fb8668f00.jpg?v=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barack Obama held a town hall meeting in Medford, Oregon today with 1,500 people -- and he greeted another 800 in the overflow room. KTVL &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ktvl.com/news/meeting_1185999___article.html/barack_message.html&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message was change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senator Barack Obama greeted more than fifteen hundred people at Kids Unlimited in Medford this morning. The senator first greeted supporters in an overflow area in the front of the building for several minutes before heading into the Olsrud Gymnasium at about 10:00 a.m., about a half-hour behind schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senator Obama was introduced by a Medford campaign supporter Denise Cyr, who told us she was selected to introduce him because of her enthusiasm. Also speaking before the senator was Retired General Tony McPeak, who is a former Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crowd chanted &amp;quot;yes, we can&amp;quot; as Senator Obama made his way to the center of the room. He began his speech by talking about his background and what drew him into politics. He said he is often asked why he is running for president so soon, at such a relatively young age. Senator Obama said, as Doctor Martin Luther King, Junior used to say, he believes in the &amp;quot;fierce urgency of now.&amp;quot; Senator Obama described this as a difining moment in history, in which our economy is in shambles and our schools are unable to compete in a global economy. The senator said we can&#039;t wait to fix the problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;     &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2194/2352186949_6df79c2069.jpg?v=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Please &lt;a href=&quot;https://donate.barackobama.com/page/contribute/math?source=HQBlog&quot;&gt;make a donation&lt;/a&gt; today and help grow the movement in Oregon and beyond...</description>

            <title>Video: More Voices</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;When Barack Obama graduated from Harvard Law School -- where he served as editor of the prestigious Harvard Law Review -- he could have worked at a top private law firm or clerked for a federal judge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, he chose to return to Chicago -- where he had spent three years as a community organizer -- and lead a voter registration drive, bringing 150,000 more voices into the political process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the story of Project Vote, an extraordinary voter registration and mobilization project that altered the political landscape in Illinois and helped move our country in a better, different direction...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;355&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/Px1Ut433xPU&amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;transparent&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/Px1Ut433xPU&amp;hl=en&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; wmode=&quot;transparent&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;355&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it&#039;s time for all of us to do our part. Let&#039;s make this movement bigger by bringing in new voters and adding more voices to our democracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/contact/splash/callpa&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.barackobama.com/images/voterreg/mv_pa_makecalls.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://donate.barackobama.com/page/contribute/morevoices?source=LP_MVN&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.barackobama.com/images/voterreg/mv_donate_sm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Oregon: Spring to Action</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;From the beginning, one of the goals of this campaign has been to bring people back into the political process, to empower them to help bring about change one community at a time. Today marks the first day of spring, and to celebrate, supporters across the country are organizing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/springtoaction&quot;&gt;national day of grassroots fundraising events&lt;/a&gt; to take place &lt;strong&gt;Saturday, March 29th&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Spring is here and there is no better time to celebrate change!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past few weeks we&#039;ve heard divisiveness, conflict, and cynicism dominating the political conversation of our nation.&amp;nbsp; But, we know that what binds us together is stronger than what drives us apart and the genius of America is that out of many, we are one.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Saturday, March 29th, grassroots groups across the country will join together to celebrate this season of change and raise money to ensure Barack Obama&#039;s message of hope and unity reaches communities from Pennsylvania to Indiana and from Oregon to Kentucky.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Host a Spring to Action Fundraiser to raise money for the campaign and share more information about Barack Obama with those in your neighborhood. We&#039;ll provide you with tips and resources for your event in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/springtoaction&quot;&gt;Spring to Action Fundraiser Host Guide&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are still ten more contests in the Democratic primary election and now is the time to make a fresh commitment to impact this election by taking action in your area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/springtoaction&quot;&gt;Learn more about hosting a Spring to Action Fundraiser and create your event today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for bringing our country together, one community at a time, to support change! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Nikki Sutton&lt;br /&gt;Obama for America Online Organizer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;          &lt;p&gt;You can find ideas and suggestions on how to organize a grassroots fundraiser in your own community in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/springtoaction/&quot;&gt;Spring to Action Fundraiser Host Guide&lt;/a&gt;. And if you haven&amp;rsquo;t created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com&quot;&gt;My.BarackObama.com&lt;/a&gt; account yet, there&amp;rsquo;s no better time than now. It&amp;rsquo;s free, it only takes a minute, and it will allow you to connect with groups, events and supporters in your own community and across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grassroots events can also be a great chance to make sure that your friends, family and neighbors are all registered to vote. In Oregon, the deadline to register as a Democrat is April 29th. You can find Oregon &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/orvoterreg&quot;&gt;voter registration information here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By organizing, by educating, by registering voters and raising money for the work ahead, we can not only impact the next ten contests, we can begin to lay the groundwork for the campaign for the presidency in November. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>&#039;The grass-roots thing&#039;</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/dt.cms.support.viewStory.cls?cid=80719&amp;amp;sid=1&amp;amp;fid=1&quot;&gt; &lt;em&gt;Register Guard:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/-/blog/logo_RegisterGuard.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;214&quot; height=&quot;30&quot; /&gt;	 	 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Friday&#039;s arena-size rallies for Barack Obama may offer the splashiest evidence that Oregon is in play as one of the last presidential primaries before the summer&#039;s Democratic primaries. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But there are visible signs, too, that he and Democratic rival Hillary Rodham Clinton are gearing up for a showdown in Oregon for its 65 Democratic delegates. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Obama, who will address at least 20,000 people combined at events in Portland, Eugene and Salem, appears to have thousands more at work on his behalf in advance of the May 20 primary. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;quot;... the Obama campaign is getting new people involved &amp;mdash; it&#039;s really strong on college campuses, really working the grass-roots thing,&amp;quot; said Jim Moore, a political commentator and professor at Pacific University in Forest Grove. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ... [Obama&#039;s Oregon campaign committee chariman, U.S. Rep. Earl] Blumenauer readily acknowledged that Obama doesn&#039;t have a big apparatus in Oregon. But that&#039;s not what is going to deliver the state for the Illinois senator. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;quot;The breadth of this volunteer support, the ability to get people engaged, is going to make the difference,&amp;quot; Blumenauer said. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; He described the Obama campaign&#039;s strength as its bottom-up approach to voter outreach. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Matt Keating, a Lane Community College student, vouched for that. He and other Obama backers recently formed a college-sanctioned club that has spent the past two weeks &amp;quot;tabling&amp;quot; for its candidate in the college&#039;s cafeteria. That is, passing out campaign information and getting fellow students &amp;mdash; typically 40 per day &amp;mdash; registered as Democratic voters so they can take part in the party&#039;s upcoming primary. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ... One of the campaigning tactics [Obama staffer Jonathan] Manton has been impressed with is Obama&#039;s precinct campaign program. In each precinct, volunteers go door to door talking to neighbors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;quot;They aren&#039;t given messages from the national campaign. They&#039;re not scripted,&amp;quot; Manton said. &amp;quot;It&#039;s just volunteers who care about their community. They care about their country...&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

            <title>Oregon AFSCME Endorses Obama</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the progressive blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blueoregon.com/2008/03/breaking-oregon.html&quot;&gt;Blue Oregon&lt;/a&gt; broke the news that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oregonafscme.com/&quot;&gt;Oregon AFSCME&lt;/a&gt; union workers had voted to endorse Barack Obama for President. According to Blue Oregon, &amp;quot;Oregon AFSCME&#039;s executive director, Ken Allen, described the vote as &#039;overwhelming.&#039;&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an official statement released last night, the Oregon AFSCME explained:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;The union took action prior to the upcoming Oregon primary because Obama has a history of standing up and fighting for working people,&amp;quot; said Oregon AFSCME Executive Director Ken Allen. &amp;quot;In Illinois, Sen. Obama fought alongside AFSCME to keep vital public services open, including mental hospitals and prisons. He also worked to help organize thousands of workers at Resurrection Hospital, and supported card check recognition for other workers seeking to unionize in their workplace. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;He is a candidate organized labor can proudly stand behind and support.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;... &amp;ldquo;I believe Obama can unite Democrats, Republicans and independents alike, which is what our membership within Corrections looks like,&amp;rdquo; [Corrections Counselor Tina Turner-Morfitt] said. &amp;ldquo;This endorsement best reflects the thinking of our members and leaders.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;... With the Obama endorsement, Oregon AFSCME joins the other biggest unions in Oregon supporting Obama in the Oregon primary, including the Oregon Education Association, the Teamsters, Service Employees International Union, the United Food and Commercial Workers and others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Oregon AFSCME plans to send out mailings to its members, and to participate in get-out-the-vote activities for Barack during the lead-up to Oregon&#039;s May 20th primary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oregonafscme.com/?zone=/unionactive/view_article.cfm&amp;amp;HomeID=82082&quot;&gt;Read the full Oregon AFSCME statement endorsing Barack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://or.barackobama.com&quot;&gt;OR.BarackObama.com&lt;/a&gt; for more news and info from Oregon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oregonafscme.com/?zone=/unionactive/view_article.cfm&amp;amp;HomeID=82082&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>

            <title>Memo from David Plouffe: Moving On to the Next 10 Contests</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;David Plouffe sent out this memo today...&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his overwhelming victory in the Mississippi primary, Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s lead in pledged delegates is now wider than it was on March 3, before the contests in Ohio and Texas. He netted more delegates in Mississippi and Wyoming than Senator Clinton netted on March 4. Obama now holds a pledged delegate lead of 161 with a total of 1411 pledged delegates, while Senator Clinton trails with 1250 pledged delegates. &amp;nbsp;As the number of remaining pledged delegates dwindles, Hillary Clinton&amp;rsquo;s path to the nomination seems less and less plausible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barack Obama has now won nearly thirty contests, over half the states in the country, including critical battleground states like Virginia, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, Colorado, Missouri, Washington and Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that Mississippi is behind us, we move on to the next ten contests. The Clinton Campaign would like to focus your attention only on Pennsylvania &amp;ndash; a state in which they have already declared that they are &amp;ldquo;unbeatable.&amp;rdquo; But Pennsylvania is only one of 10 remaining contests, each important in terms of allocating delegates and ultimately deciding who are nominee will be. Senator Obama campaigned in Pennsylvania yesterday and will do so again later this week, but he will also campaign aggressively in the other upcoming states &amp;ndash; he will travel to other upcoming states in the very near future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have activated our volunteer networks, are putting staff on the ground, and building our organization in every one of the upcoming states. The key is not who wins the states that the Clinton campaign thinks are important. Throughout this entire process, they have cherry-picked states, diminished caucuses, and moved the goal posts to create a shifting, twisted rationale for why they should win the nomination despite winning fewer primaries, fewer states, fewer delegates, and fewer votes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;            &lt;p&gt;You can help us win the next three contests in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Indiana. Pick up the phone today and &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/call&quot;&gt;make some calls&lt;/a&gt;!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Rolling Stone: &#039;Barack Obama&#039;s Machinery of Hope&#039;</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;The new issue of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/19106326&quot;&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; magazine features an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/19106326&quot;&gt;in-depth cover story&lt;/a&gt; on the incredible grassroots support that has built up around this campaign, and how supporters are combining &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com&quot;&gt;online tools&lt;/a&gt; and offline organzing to transform the political process:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/19106326&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ed/RollingStone-Logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;443&quot; height=&quot;95&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over the past year, the Obama campaign has quietly worked to integrate the online technologies that fueled the rise of Howard Dean &amp;mdash;as well as social-networking and video tools that didn&#039;t even exist in 2004 &amp;mdash; with the kind of neighbor-to-neighbor movement-building that Obama learned as a young organizer on the streets of Chicago. &amp;quot;That&#039;s the magic of what they&#039;ve done,&amp;quot; says Simon Rosenberg, president of the Democratic think tank NDN. &amp;quot;They&#039;ve married the incredibly powerful online community they built with real on-the-ground field operations. We&#039;ve never seen anything like this before in American political history.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;...According to David Axelrod, the campaign&#039;s chief strategist, the bottom-up ethos of the campaign comes straight from the top. &amp;quot;When we started this race, Barack told us that he wanted the campaign to be a vehicle for involving people and giving them a stake in the kind of organizing he believed in,&amp;quot; Axelrod says. &amp;quot;He is still the same guy who came to Chicago as a community organizer twenty-three years ago. The idea that we can organize together and improve our country &amp;mdash; I mean, he really &lt;em&gt;believes&lt;/em&gt; that.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  ...Temo Figueroa&#039;s goal is not to put supporters to work but to enable them to put themselves to work, without having to depend on the campaign for constant guidance. &amp;quot;We decided that we didn&#039;t want to train volunteers,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;We want to train organizers &amp;mdash; folks who can fend for themselves.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;...&amp;quot;That was a very important test for us,&amp;quot; says Hildebrand. &amp;quot;Can we make this work offline? We said to our online supporters, &#039;We love you, but we need you to actually go to work in your neighborhood.&#039; Their online support was only great if we could translate it into activity within their community.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the same time, the campaign was developing a new high-tech toolbox to enable its supporters to keep the momentum going &amp;mdash; both online and off. With the help of one of the founders of Facebook, the Obama campaign created, &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com&quot;&gt;MyBo&lt;/a&gt;, its own social-networking tool, through which supporters could organize themselves however they saw fit. Today, the network claims more than half a million members and more than 8,000 affinity groups. Some are organized by state (Ohioans for Obama), others by profession (Texas Business Women for Obama) and still others by groove thing (Soul Music Lovers for Obama).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...Using the social-networking tools of &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com&quot;&gt;MyBo&lt;/a&gt;, the volunteers began to create city- and statewide networks with names like IdahObama, groups that could be tapped later by the professional staff to organize down to the precinct level. In Maryland, the campaign was able to mobilize 3,000 volunteers in only three weeks, thanks to the months of groundwork by groups like Baltimore for Barack Obama.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;...No group represents the campaign machine that Obama has built better than AlamObama. A year ago, the group was nothing more than eight people who attended an informal get-together at a Borders bookstore. Today, it&#039;s a 600-member grass-roots outfit &amp;mdash; an all-volunteer field operation that hums with the energy and efficiency of a fully staffed campaign office. &amp;quot;In Iowa, the campaign was on the ground for six months,&amp;quot; says Judy Hall, a college professor who co-founded the group. &amp;quot;They come here, and it&#039;s like they&#039;ve already been on the ground for six months. Those of us in the grass roots, we simply minded the store.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well,&amp;quot; she says, reconsidering her words, &amp;quot;I guess we actually &lt;em&gt;built&lt;/em&gt; the store &amp;mdash; but that&#039;s what this campaign is all about.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you haven&#039;t already created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/&quot;&gt;My.BarackObama.com&lt;/a&gt; account, &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com&quot;&gt;sign up today&lt;/a&gt;. You can find other supporters in your area, &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com//&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; plan events in your community and become a full-fledged member of the Obama grassroots movement... &lt;/p&gt;</description>
